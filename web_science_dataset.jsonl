{"question": "Can headbanging cause brain damage?", "questionId": "14138", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/14138", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "A number of injuries have been attributed to the practice of head-banging to music. \n\nThe following list are individual case-studies, so should be considered little more than well-considered anecdotes.\n\n\nCarotid Dissection - a 15 year-old died of an aneurysm.\nSubdural Haemorrhage - 29-year-old had headaches for a week.\nFatal Subdural haemorrhage - No abstract available.\nMediastinal Emphysema - A 34-year-old guitarist regularly expeirneced neck and chest pain after concerts.\nNeck weakness and long-term neck pain and upper limb parasthesia - a 16-year-old suffered a neck injury while head-banging that continued to show symptoms for 4 years. No validated diagnosis was made.\nVetebral Artery Aneurysm - a 15-year-old drummer suffered an aneurysm from violent head and neck motion. \"He is neurologically normal 1 year after surgery\"\nBasal Artery Thrombosis - 20 year old musician. While it is likely that head-banging caused the problem, it is not clear. He suffered further in hospital during treatment (I couldn't quite understand the details, but \"the therapeutic intervention had resulted in significant neurological disability.\")\n\nThis article goes on to provide several references for head-banging related injuries (mostly covered elsewhere here).\n\n\nThe following studies are more than just case-studies.\n\n\nWhiplash - Thirty-seven 13/14 year olds partook in a charity dance marathon for 7 hours. 82% of the girls and 17% of the boys who partook in headbanging during three heavy metal songs suffered cervical spine pain for 1-3 days. 26.2% of the girls and none of the boys who did not partake in headbanging suffered cervical spine pain. \nHead and Neck Injury - This was a biomechanical analysis of head-banging, rather than measuring actual outcomes.\n\n\n\n  An average head banging song has a tempo of about 146 beats per minute, which is predicted to cause mild head injury when the range of motion is greater than 75\u00b0. At higher tempos and greater ranges of motion there is a risk of neck injury.\n  \n  To minimise the risk of head and neck injury, head bangers should decrease their range of head and neck motion, head bang to slower tempo songs by replacing heavy metal with adult oriented rock, only head bang to every second beat, or use personal protective equipment.\n\n\nClearly, head-banging has been associated with injuries, including some fatal. The brain injuries appear to have had immediate effect. \n\nI found no evidence that long-term head-banging causes cumulative brain-damage, even in an article that attempted to summarise the risks. The biomechanical analysis did not warn against long-term use, but merely advised on prevention techniques.\n\nNonetheless, these immediate risks should be considered when deciding whether head-banging is worth it.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/14138#14139", "answerId": "14139"}
{"question": "Does the Shangri-La diet work (according to its supposed mechanism)?", "questionId": "10103", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10103", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "The Shangri-La diet depends on two theories:\n\n\nThe Set-Point Theory, that claims the brain - in particular the hypothalamus - has a target weight, and it adjusts the body's resting metabolic rate (RMR) to ensure that the target weight is achieved.\nThe brain's target weight is set by one parameter that can be adjusted lower through the use of bland foods.\n\n\nSet-Point Theory is controversial, in that it is popular, but lacks scientific evidence.\n\nBruce Jancin of International Medical News writes: \n\n\n  It's high time to toss out the long-popular set point theory of obesity, according to speakers at an international conference of the Academy for Eating Disorders. \n  \n  The set point theory holds that obesity entails a metabolic defect that functions as a homeostatic mechanism. This defect is supposed to result in a slowdown of resting metabolic rate in an overweight or obese individual who has lost weight. The resultant reduction in energy expenditure is said to be responsible for the often-observed scenario in which the individual regains the weight that was lost and thereby returns to his or her set point. \n  \n  The set point theory enjoys widespread popularity among the overweight public, in whom it fosters a fatalism regarding the condition of obesity. The theory also holds sway among many physicians who work with obese patients and/or those with eating disorders. \n  \n  But scientific support for the set point theory is limited to old data derived from outdated methods of physiologic measurement. \n\n\nA 1990 study published in FASEB, Role of set-point theory in regulation of body weight, is an example of research contradicting set-point theory:\n\n\n  Current working hypotheses include roles for nutrients, dietary composition and organoleptic properties, hormones, neural pathways, various brain nuclei, and many neurotransmitters in the regulation of food intake. It is concluded that regulation of body weight in relation to one specific parameter related to energy balance is unrealistic. It seems appropriate to assume that the level at which body weight and body fat content are maintained represents the equilibria achieved by regulation of many parameters.\n\n\nSo, it isn't one point in your brain deciding on your target weight, but lots of different factors throughout the body.\n\nWhat about the research that supports it? \n\nWell, the article quoted in the question is this one:\n\n\nLomangino, Kevin, Shangri-La in a Bottle (of Olive Oil)?, Nutrition &amp; the M.D.: April 2007 - Volume 33 - Issue 4 - p 6 doi: 10.1097/01.NMD.0000265129.09365.bd\n\n\nWhile this looks like a journal article, in fact, it is just a few paragraphs (less than a page) explaining what the diet is and nothing else. There is no evidence here to support it.\n\nThere do seem to be legitimate researchers out there who take the complicated version of set-point theory seriously. \n\nIn a 2007 article published in Diabetes Spectrum, The Physiology of Body Weight Regulation: Are We Too Efficient for Our Own Good?:\n\n\n  This so-called set-point theory of body weight regulation has been slowly developed over a number of years and backed by a plethora of experimental approaches.\n\n\nThey go on to cite at least five studies they claim support the set-point theory hypothesis. One of which was the first one I listed above. Some of which are rodent studies, which may not apply to humans.\n\nThey make the case that the best evidence for the set-point theory is that it is ubiquitous among weight-loss studies that the participants regain the weight, going back to their original point. They claim the main mechanism here is a change in the resting metabolic rate (RMR):\n\n\n  With the body being more metabolically efficient than before, a return to the original feeding level after a period of weight loss through decreased caloric intake would regain the lost weight. For individuals who are particularly efficient, it may even lead to net weight gain.\n\n\nHowever, one of their cited papers, Do adaptive changes in metabolic rate favor weight regain in weight-reduced individuals? An examination of the set-point theory (2000, AJCN) refutes this:\n\n\n  The results also suggest that adaptive down-regulation of RMR is not a characteristic of weight-reduced individuals and does not explain their weight-regain tendency. The weight-gain tendency of obesity-prone persons appears to be caused by factors other than variations in metabolic rate.\n\n\nOther factors, not RMR, explains why dieters tend to return to their original weight.\n\nIn conclusion: There are some complex versions of set-point theory that researchers are still working on, involving many (rather than a single) biological feedback loops. \n\nRoberts vastly oversimplifies the theory by reducing it to a single parameter. His version of set-point theory is not supported by the scientific research.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10103#16121", "answerId": "16121"}
{"question": "Can phobias be genetic, but created in one generation and not by natural selection?", "questionId": "18713", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/18713", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "This question has remained unanswered yet not closed, so I'll give it a go. \n\nFirst of all, a clarification regarding the title. If phobias are genetic, by definition they can't be created in a generation and inherited. The term epigenetic is the one that might have led to this confusion, so I'll start by defining it.\n\n1. Epigenetics\n\nEpigenetics is the study of changes in the expression of genes caused by certain base pairs in DNA, or RNA, being \"turned off\" or \"turned on\" again, through chemical reactions (source). Epi means outside or around, so epigenetics is not genetics as you might define it. These changes happen at a genomic level, but they don't involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. The best example of epigenetics is the fertilized egg cell or zygote, that divides and changes into all the different cell types in an organism (muscle cells, neurons, epithelium). They do this by activating some genes while inhibiting the expression of others.\n\nThe best definition is probably Arthur Riggs': \n\n\n  [Epigenetics is] the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable\n  changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA\n  sequence.\n\n\n2. Can mice inherit fears applied to their predecedssors?\n\nThe study you cite affirms they can. Even a third generation of mice seemed to reject the smell as well, which makes for quite shocking news:\n\n\n  The third generation of mice \u2014 the \u2018grandchildren\u2019 \u2014 also inherited\n  this reaction, as did mice conceived through in vitro fertilization\n  with sperm from males sensitized to acetophenone.\n\n\nThe problem with the study is that it failed to figure out a mechanism by which this could happen. And without knowing the molecular mechanism behind it, there is no choice but to remain skeptic. \n\n3. A partial conclusion\n\nThis is undoubtedly a breakthrough discovery, the possibility of imprinting associations such as this in a gamete is simply astonishing. From an evolutionary point of view, it can make sense that (in some way we don't understand yet) some signals regarding experience can be transmitted to our descendants and somehow help in their survival. \n\nThe cited study belongs to epigenetics because this information cannot be stored at a nucleotide level. Unfortunately, and as I previously mentioned, without knowing the details of the mechanism we can't categorically affirm these mice inherited the information associated with a traumatic experience. \n\nEven in a laboratory context, there are too many unknown variables we might be missing. One important one has been brought up by Martin Johnsson, and it has to do with the study using two groups of mice, one subjected to the scent and the other one not, and their descendants. If you divide individuals into two groups, you need to be sure that there are not genetic differences between the founders of the two groups. This is not clarified in the study, and could potentially explain the supposed 'inheritance' if no other reason comes to light. \n\nSo to summarize: The experiment seems to affirm it's possible. However, without a mechanism we are left with too many unknowns to consider this a proven theory. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/18713#22322", "answerId": "22322"}

Once something is dead there is no point trying to kill it a second time, so boiling once just before use is sufficient.\n\nBoiling water will also reduce the concentration of volatile contaminants - making the water safer (Reference)\n\nIf you boil water for a very long time, you may reduce the total volume of water to say half, this would double the concentration of any dissolved compounds that are less volatile than water (Example for reference purposes). Normal use of electric kettles doesn't reduce the volume of water sufficiently to make this a concern. \n\nDioxins\n\nDioxins have low volatility and low water solubility (Reference). So they only appear in sediment, if you filter out the sediment you should remove most of the dioxins. If you boil your water for a long time and condense the steam and drink that (i.e. distilled water) you would reduce the quantity of dioxins ingested. \n\nConclusions\n\n1: Dioxins (if any) in your water are probably more likely to be present in sediment in the bottom of the kettle than dissolved in the water. Modern kettles turn themselves off before significant volume of water is boiled off and so don't produce high concentrations from low concentrations. Rinse your kettle once a week if worried.\n\n2: It isn't the ordinal number of boilings that is important, it is the reduction in volume of the water - which is related to boiling time. This isn't a significant factor for normal use of domestic kettles.\n\nSo I conclude the claim is wrong.\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nIs it safe to drink reboiled water? at Chemistry.SE\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/11118#11119", "answerId": "11119"}

{"question": "Is the ninth wave the largest?", "questionId": "9805", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9805", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "No, there isn't any pattern to the waves. In fact, the wave are defined as \"with random periods/frequencies\", as you can see in this paper of modeling of sea waves and sea states, this is mainly due to how the waves are generated due action of wind, also as is described here, there, this webpage (more easy to understand), another page or in the extend bibliography, or this other bibliography list.\n\nSo we can cite the following: (My additions in bold):\n\n\n  Wind energy is imparted to the sea surface through friction and pressure, causing waves. (impossible for wind to \"select waves\" to give more energy) As the wind gains strength, the surface develops gradually from flat and smooth through growing levels of roughness. First, ripples form, then larger waves, called chop. The waves continue to build, their maximum size depending on three factors: wind speed, wind duration, and the area over which the wind is blowing, called the fetch. When ocean waves are as large as they can get under the current conditions of wind speed and size of fetch, the sea surface is said to be \u201cfully developed.\u201d\n  \n  In the fetch, many different groups of waves of varying wavelength are generated and interfere (noted in the literature as sea state). As they disperse away from the fetch, the waves become more regularly sized and spaced (knows a swell state). This is because the speed of a wave in open water is closely related to its wavelength. The different groups of waves move at different speeds and so are naturally sorted by wavelength.\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nEven when is possible for two wave trains (generated by two diferent storms or conditions) to converge (as the largest, fastest-moving waves at the fore of the second train can \"catch\", the smaller, slower-moving ones behind of the first train) or the sorting of wave frequencies as described above, generate waves coupling that can be interpreted as this \"ninth wave\" this effect is accidental due the difficulty of measure wave height at naked eye, variability of amplitude of wave and phasing of waves ratios and due the fact the most wave have periods between 8 and 26 seconds and is extremely hard get in the sea periods ratios of 9 to 10 to generate this \"ninth wave\".\n\nI hope this helps\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9805#9963", "answerId": "9963"}
{"question": "Does gelatin aid hair and nail growth?", "questionId": "27204", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27204", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "I did a quick google search on this one and the first result I got back was this link which explains the history of knox gelatin and when it started being used as a supplement to allegedly increase nail strength which was around the 1950s. Here is the main section that explains why this myth is false and why gelatin doesn't help nails.\n\n\n  Nails and Food\n  \n  Gelatin does contain some protein. However, if protein were\n  responsible for improving brittle, peeling nails, gelatin would be a\n  poor choice, given the fact that other foods are much higher in\n  protein. Eating or drinking gelatin won't strengthen weak nails, nor\n  will soaking your hands in gelatin. Peeling nails are rarely caused by\n  nutritional deficiencies. As long as you eat a healthy, varied diet\n  abundant in essential nutrients, your diet won't affect nail quality.\n  Peeling nails are more frequently caused by external factors.\n  \n  Nail Tips\n  \n  Peeling nails are usually the result of repeatedly getting them wet\n  and letting them dry again. Washing your hands and doing certain\n  household chores \u2014 washing dishes, scrubbing the bathtub and watering\n  the lawn \u2014 make nails brittle and dry. A better investment than\n  gelatin is a good moisturizer that contains lanolin or alpha-hydroxy\n  acids. Protect your nails by wearing cotton-lined rubber gloves when\n  doing housework. Limit the number of times you change your nail polish\n  and use acetone-free polish remover when you do.\n\n\nHere is explains that Gelatin while containing some protein won't do much for nails since that isn't what is responsible for improving your nails. This is because nails are usually weakened by external factors such as nail polish, nail polish remover, and being wet for long periods of time. So no gelatin will not increase nail strength.\n\nThere is another link Here that better explains what the nails are made up of how they grow, and what determines their strength. Here is the specific portion refutuing the claim that nails can be strengthened by certain foods.\n\n\n  Some people erroneously believe that eating certain foods or using\n  special creams, oils or lotions will increase the growth rate.\n  Although the nail plate requires certain nutrients for proper growth,\n  there is very little evidence that eating any particular food will\n  cause them to grow faster. Creams, oils and lotions are sometimes sold\n  as \u2018growth accelerators\u2019, although these claims are false, misleading\n  and illegal. No cosmetic product may claim that it can alter or change\n  any body function. These products and others are only for beautifying\n  the nail plate, and only medical drugs can make such claims.\n\n\nWhile this is talking about growth the same idea applies to the hardness\nthe food you eat does not affect your nails in any noticeable way, unless\nyou are malnourished or have a medical condition. Also while the biotin solution\nmentioned in the livestrong one which isn't supported but the rest of the livestrong stuff based on strength of nails is.\n\nEdit: Updated with a new link as livestrong isn't reliable, but the new source from a educational website for nail technicians agrees.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27204#27206", "answerId": "27206"}

There's many metals used, and then there's alloys of those metals.\nTin (or rather tin plated steel alloy), and aluminium seem the most common. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can\n\nWikipedia has this to say about tin poisoning from cans: \n\n\n  Tin has no known natural biological role in living organisms. It is not easily absorbed by animals and humans. The low toxicity is relevant to the widespread use of tin in dinnerware and canned food.[1] Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been reported after ingesting canned food containing 200 mg/kg of tin.[2] This observation led, for example, the Food Standards Agency in the UK to propose upper limits of 200 mg/kg.[3] A study showed that 99.5% of the controlled food cans contain tin in an amount below that level.[4]\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_poisoning\n\nFor aluminium, toxicity is even less apparently:\n\n\n  Despite its natural abundance, aluminium has no known function in biology. It is remarkably nontoxic, aluminium sulfate having an LD50 of 6207 mg/kg (oral, mouse), which corresponds to 500 grams for a 80 kg person.[6] The extremely low acute toxicity notwithstanding, the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce.\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_poisoning#Health_concerns\n\nThus, it's highly unlikely you'll suffer any ill effects from food exposed to the metal of your can.\n\nIn the past lead solder was used to seal the cans, which did lead to poisoning as lead of course is rather toxic (which was not well understood at the time):\n\n\n  Early cans were sealed with lead soldering, which led to lead poisoning. Famously, in the 1845 Arctic expedition of Sir John Franklin, crew members suffered from severe lead poisoning thought to be caused by eating canned food. More recent research suggests the lead poisoning was more likely to have been caused by the internal pipe system on the ships.\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can\nThis could well be the origin of this myth, however the poisoning could happen with sealed as well as opened cans.\nNow, with the scare about BPA poisoning, the internal coating/liner of modern cans is blamed by some for all kinds of scary diseases as well, but as mentioned in other questions there is no real scientific evidence to back up the claims that BPA is toxic in the concentrations found in those linings except maybe for infants.\nFor example a recent US government study indicates that:\n\n\n\n  \n  For infants and children the Expert Panel has the following levels of concern for biological processes that might be altered by Bisphenol A, as follows:\n  \u2022 some concern for neural and behavioral effects\n  \u2022 minimal concern for the effect of accelerated puberty\n  For adults, the Expert Panel has negligible concern for adverse reproductive effects following exposures in the general population to Bisphenol A. For highly exposed subgroups, such as occupationally exposed populations, the level of concern is elevated to minimal.[8]:382-383[61]\n  \n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol-A\n\n\nErgo, I can only conclude that there is no reason to assume that having open cans in the fridge as storage containers would cause any adverse effects on your health, as long as the same precautions are taken as with any other food container. Any effects that might ensue would be no different from having the sealed can in there.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/16799#16809", "answerId": "16809"}

{"question": "Does white noise improve concentration?", "questionId": "8025", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8025", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Keep in mind the way they're defining \"white noise\" in the scientific american article you provided is different from what you link to on wikipedia.  The SA definition is more in terms of ambient noise (e.g., traffic, low-level talking, a/c running, etc.) while white noise proper is a signal with a VERY specific acoustical pattern.  It seems that the SA article is relating to deterioration in performance due to the stress caused by the increased attentional resources required to \"tune-out\" the ambient noise.  If white noise proper completely eliminates all other ambient noise (without being too loud of course), this eliminates the allocation of these additional resources.  Because white noise proper is essentially featureless, one will habituate to it unlike common ambient noise.\n\nCarlson, Rama, Artchakov, &amp; Linnankoski (1997) found a significant decrease in memory when exposed to music during a memory task and a significant increase in performance when exposed to white noise in comparison to a control which had only low level ambient noise.  Though it was not the main purpose of the study, the authors conclude that music drew attention away and thus interfered while white noise likely drowned out the ambient noise without drawing attention and thus improved performance.  Please keep in mind the sample of this study was on monkeys, but the processes are expected to be generalizable to humans.\n\nDaee &amp; Wilding (1977) found that the likelihood of forgetting during a free recall task is related to the level of noise to which one is exposed during rehearsal such that recall is best in a quiet environment and degrades at 75 and 85 dB.  Though this study was not on concentration directly, these results can be seen to have applicable implications regarding attentional resources.\n\nAlong these same lines, Salame &amp; Baddeley (1987) found significant differences in recall between unattended speech versus white noise such that unattended speech interferes with performance while no statistical difference was found in the white noise condition (in comparison to a quiet control).  The authors conclude \"...that noise does not interfere with short-term memory but that unattended speech does impair performance...\"\n\nThe studies I cite above are related to memory recall tasks which, though involving similar processes to long-term concentration are not perfectly comparable.  However, there is a pretty comprehensive literature showing the effects of noise exposure having negative effects on long-term tasks such as learning (e.g., Hygge, 1993, Lercher, Evans, &amp; Meis, 2003).  Additionally, Mathews &amp; Canon, 1975 state \"data [suggests] that arousal leads to a state of restricted attention or cue utilization in which attention is concentrated on salient features of the setting at the expense of its other aspects\" which does not hinder attention to \"central or salient events.\"  This idea is related to the theory that noise facilitates functioning through the stimulation of processing such that increased arousal yields better performance until over-arousal occurs which then decreases performance (Hockey, 1983 from Staal, 2004).  Stall (2004) also discusses the possibility of continuous v. intermittent noises having differential impact such that continuous may be beneficial while intermittent is harmful, though there is no current agreement in the literature (see pages 88-91).\n\nThus, the literature seems to support the following:\n\nWhite noise will improve performance to the extent to which it masks noises that may cause over-arousal or attention shifts away from the task without causing over-arousal itself.  Practically speaking, if you're in a quiet environment, white noise is unlikely to have a positive effect on your concentration.  If you are in a somewhat noisy environment, white noise will likely have a positive effect.  However, in a very noisy environment it will likely have either no or a negative effect.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8025#8066", "answerId": "8066"}

However, it does briefly summarise the purported causes of early puberty.\n\n\n  Improving nutrition is generally assumed to be responsible for the secular trend to ever-earlier onset of menarche in Western industrialised countries.\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n  Nutritional factors are likely to be responsible and current option is that menarche is provoked by a critical accumulation of adipose tissue rather than through the effects of specific macronutrients [17]. Studies in the USA and Canada have found that earlier onset of menarche is associated with a greater height and weight for age and that after allowing for these variables, there was no association with energy-adjusted intake of fat, protein or carbohydrate in the diet [23, 24]. Nevertheless one prospective study in Germany concluded that a higher energy-adjusted fat intake was associated with accelerated menarche and might be responsible for earlier body fatness [25].\n\n\n\n\n14: Outwater JL, et al.

It is off-topic for our discussion, but on-topic for the general article.\n\nSecond, it doesn't conclude anything useful for the article\n\n\n  In conclusion, despite several intriguing hypotheses linking dairy product consumption and breast cancer, the available epidemiologic evidence does not support a strong association between the consumption of milk or other dairy products and breast cancer risk.\n\n\nThird, it is published in Med Hypotheses, which is a great place to get ideas for future experiments, but not a great place to link to to show that the evidence supports your argument.

The canonical form of the metric was developed and published in [6] which provided key insight into the field potential and boost for the field which remedied a critical paradox in the original Alcubierre concept of operations. A modified concept of operations based on the canonical form of the metric that remedies the paradox is presented and discussed. The idea of a warp drive in higher dimensional space-time (manifold) will then be briefly considered by comparing the null-like geodesics of the Alcubierre metric to the Chung-Freese metric to illustrate the mathematical role of hyperspace coordinates.

{"question": "Is inhaling helium dangerous?", "questionId": "19298", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19298", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "Yes helium can be dangerous, but usually because of other risky behaviour associated with taking it\n\nStatistically speaking it looks as though helium is associated a small, but increasing number of deaths. The following picture is based on mentions of helium on English death certificates (original source this tweet):\n\n\n\nBut this doesn't help understand whether the problem is that the gas was helium or whether the users were doing something else that created or exacerbated the risk. Since helium is inert and doesn't have any direct physiological affects (though there are some small positive effects, see next reference) it is a little implausible that it is the direct primary cause of death. Helium is used safely in medicine and deep sea diving in gas mixtures that also contain oxygen. \n\nOf course, pure helium will displace oxygen leading to potential asphyxiation. But it isn't obviously easy to achieve that just by breathing it from a balloon. If you inhale enough to become unconscious, you won't breathe any more of the helium and the worst risk is likely to be related to fainting. As soon as you fall you are in air and will regain the required supply of oxygen on refilling your lungs. As this Slate article explains:\n\n\n  You don't have to worry about fatal asphyxiation if you're sucking from a helium balloon at a party. At worst you'll keep going until you get lightheaded and pass out\u2014at which point you'll stop inhaling helium and your body's oxygen levels will return to normal. Of more concern is the possibility that you'll hurt yourself when you fall down. \n\n\nIndustrial accidents involving asphyxiation usually involve closed spaces filled with inert gas. If you faint in one of these, you are still in the dangerous, airless environment and will die quickly if not removed (see this example). It isn't easy to achieve this with helium as it is less dense than almost every other gas so will only fill spaces enclosed that are sealed completely or at the top. It has been done, though. Two students won a Darwin Award for dying after climbing into an 8' helium filled balloon in florida (reported here). In this case, though, monumental stupidity deserves a larger share of blame than helium.\n\nThere is another direct risk from trying to inhale helium, but again it isn't the helium that is the problem but the inherent risk of any compressed gas supply. As this bulletin from the Compressed Gas Association explains:\n\n\n  Attempting to inhale helium from a commercial helium balloon filling system poses a greater hazard than does inhaling helium from a balloon. Beyond the risk of passing out, the potential for fatal injury is present. Unfortunately, several young people have been killed while inhaling helium from such a system.\n  \n  How can a healthy young person be killed by a seemingly harmless substance, you ask? Postmortem examinations of victims explain what occurs, while engineering analysis explains how.\n  \n  Chemical reaction does not cause fatal injuries. Rather, the pressure of gas inside the lungs is the agent that can kill instantly. Autopsies show that the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs have been ruptured. Death follows immediately, as the victims literally drown in their own blood. Under such circumstances, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is of no avail.\n\n\nSo, strictly speaking, the risk is gas pressure not helium. \n\n\n\nTo summarise\n\nThere is no physiological effect of helium that makes it risky to inhale.\n\nBut, if the user can contrive a situation where the helium completely displaces air, asphyxiation is possible. So don't climb into gas filled balloons or put bags over your head (these are bad ideas whatever the gas.) \n\nDon't breathe any gas direct from the compressed supply, that is very risky because of the effect of uncontrolled pressure on your delicate lungs.\n\nIf you must inhale, do it from a small balloon in a room where you won't hurt yourself if you fall and where other, sober, people are present. The risks here are very low.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19298#19350", "answerId": "19350"}
{"question": "Does objectifying women in advertisement cause violence against their gender?", "questionId": "7223", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7223", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Objectification is the \"process of representing or treating a person like an object\" rather than treating them as full and equal human being with equal rights and needs. The process of representation could include portrayals of women in ways and contexts which suggest that women are objects to be looked at, ogled, touched or used, anonymous commodities/things to be purchased or to be taken and once tired of, even discarded, often to be replaced by newer, younger editions which can be further analyzed through articles mentioned here.\n\nPer Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997, objectification theory postulates that many\nwomen are sexually objectified and treated as an object to be valued for its use \nby others. Research by APA taskforce on sexuality of girls indicates that young women and adult women are frequently, consistently, and increasingly presented in sexualized ways in advertising, creating an environment in which being female becomes nearly synonymous with being a sexual object using indirect advertising techniques.\n\nThere is a strong impact made by the objectification of women within society which is shown by videos like these and ads displayed here which portray interconnectedness between violence against women (domestic and sexual violence) and the objectification of women in the media.\n\n\nPer M. Meghan Davidson in 2015, intimate partner violence is found to be linked  to body shame through body surveillance, as well as the combined effect of self-objectification and body surveillance, as theorized by objectification theory.\n\n\n\n  In addition, these findings extend objectification theory, suggesting that objectifying experiences that are not necessarily explicitly sexual in nature, but are still related to violence and dehumanization within the context of a romantic intimate relationship, can predict objectification-related variables. This finding is also consistent with the notion that violence and objectification are linked for people who perpetrate it (Moller &amp;\n  Deci, 2010) as objectification is often a precursor to enacting violence (Haslam, 2006; Johnson, 2005), as well as people who experience it given that being objectified and dehumanized is associated with experiencing violence.\n\n\n2. Some studies suggest that objectification can lead to dehumanization, which increases risk of violence. Dehumanized social perception may have detrimental consequences on attitudes and behaviors toward women, including sexual coercion, assault, and violence as well as victim-blaming.\n\n\n  Objectification is a form of dehumanization (Heflick &amp; Goldenberg, 2009; Heflick, Goldenberg, Cooper, &amp; Puvia, 2011; Loughnan, Pina, Vasquez, &amp; Puvia, 2013; Puvia &amp; Vaes, 2013). This research further connects to issues of violence against women because it is considered easier to physically violate an object compared to a human (Bandura, 2002; Nussbaum, 1999). Indeed, Loughnan, Pina, Vasquez, and Puvia (2013) found that an objectified woman was more often blamed for her own rape than a woman who was not presented in an objectified manner, and this effect was due to a decrease in moral concern for the objectified woman.\n\n\n3. There is limited but important empirical evidence for the link between objectification and violence against women.\n\n\n  Rudman and Mescher 2012 demonstrated that men who implicitly associate women with objects have a higher proclivity toward sexual aggression.\n\n\n4. Some studies have connected media exposure to sexist beliefs and acceptance of violence against women. Given that viewing sexualized and objectifying portrayals of women is associated with many of these attitudes, viewing sexualized portrayals of girls may also lead to these same effects and to a greater acceptance of child sexual abuse myths, child sexual abuse, and viewing\nchild aged girls as acceptable sexual partners. \n\n\n  Several studies have shown that viewing objectifying media perpetuates violence against women. For example, men who viewed nonviolent scenes from a movie that portrayed the objectification of women were more likely to perceive a date rape victim as enjoying her rape and being partly responsible for it occurring, compared to men who viewed a control video of a cartoon (Milburn, Mather, &amp; Conrad, 2000).\n  \n  Similarly, objectification in video games causes increased rape myth acceptance among men (Beck, Boys, Rose, &amp; Beck, 2012). Perhaps even more starkly, aggressive erotica has been experimentally shown to increase aggression toward a female target (Donnerstein, 1980). \n\n\n\nResearch by Sarah J. Gervais et.al. in 2012 shows that women are sexually objectified. Also, there\u2019s no real difference between men and women\u2019s perception of women as sexual objects. \n\n\n\n  Women's bodies were reduced to their sexual body parts in perceivers' minds. Local processing contributed to the sexual body part recognition bias, whereas global processing tempered it.\n\n\nThis shows that the cognitive process behind one's perception of objects is the same that one uses when looking at women, and both genders are guilty of taking in the parts instead of the whole. When one looks at men, he or she uses global processing to see them more fully as people.\n\n\nPer Theresa K. Vescio, recent research revealed that sexual objectification is related to decreased mind attributions, diminished perceptions of personal agency, and dehumanization.\nPer Caroline Heldman, \"internalized sexual objectification has been linked to problems with mental health  (clinical depression, \u201chabitual body monitoring\u201d), eating disorders, body shame, self-worth and life satisfaction, cognitive functioning, motor functioning, sexual dysfunction, access to leadership and political efficacy\".\nShana Meganck through review of research literature argues that regular degradation of women and portrayal of sexualized violence in the media (with particular attention paid to advertising throughout this review of the literature) provides a backdrop for rationalizing gender violence within our society. \n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7223#30246", "answerId": "30246"}

{"question": "Are old glass panes thicker on the bottom due to \"flow\"?", "questionId": "7533", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7533", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "A lot of people hear that glass is a liquid when they hear about this particular misconception. Actually it is probably better to describe glass as an amorphous solid. Any variation in thickness comes strictly from manufacturing processes.\n\n\n  Molten glass is gathered on a blowpipe, and blown to an elongated balloon shape . The ends are cut off and the resulting cylinder is split with shears while still hot, then flattened on an iron plate. This is the forerunner of the Cylinder process. The quality of the glass was not good, with many imperfections.\n\n\n(By the way, finding original source documents on actual manufacturing of glass is bloody difficult...  Many reference pages are dead, and most other pages are referring to this particular \"flow\" question.)\n\nA bit of history on glass.  Humans have known how to make glass starting as early as 3000 BCE (Yale PDF).  And the idea of making windows dates back to the height of the ancient Egyptians (though none survive that I am aware of).  However, many other glass objects are available for measurement.\n\nThe University of California Riverside has a much more in-depth description on their web page concerning the structure of glass, and explaining why it doesn't flow.  It concludes with:\n\n\n  There is no clear answer to the question \u201cIs glass solid or liquid?\u201d. In terms of molecular dynamics and thermodynamics it is possible to justify various different views that it is a highly viscous liquid, an amorphous solid, or simply that glass is another state of matter that is neither liquid nor solid. The difference is semantic. In terms of its material properties we can do little better. There is no clear definition of the distinction between solids and highly viscous liquids. All such phases or states of matter are idealisations of real material properties. Nevertheless, from a more common sense point of view, glass should be considered a solid since it is rigid according to everyday experience. The use of the term \u201csupercooled liquid\u201d to describe glass still persists, but is considered by many to be an unfortunate misnomer that should be avoided. In any case, claims that glass panes in old windows have deformed due to glass flow have never been substantiated. Examples of Roman glassware and calculations based on measurements of glass visco-properties indicate that these claims cannot be true. The observed features are more easily explained as a result of the imperfect methods used to make glass window panes before the float glass process was invented.\n\n\nGlasslinks has some additional information about the properties of glass itself:\n\n\n  \u201cThe idea that glass is a fluid is a very widespread myth,\u201d says Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician and spoilsport at the University of Adelaide in Australia. \u201cI was told it as a fact by my adviser. And once, a class of schoolchildren came into the lab, and one of them told me the very same thing. If you want to talk microscopically, then you can call glass a fluid. But people understandably tend to think that if it\u2019s a fluid, it flows. It\u2019s that notion that\u2019s false.\u201dStokes has recently proved with detailed calculations that old windows could not have flowed perceptibly.\n  \n  If the myth survives, it will be because it contains a kernel of truth \u2013 and because glass is a confusing kind of matter, quite unlike the three ordinary kinds. A gas is an anarchy of molecules going every which way; a liquid is a tighter but still disorderly society in which molecules constantly dissolve and reestablish weak bonds; a solid is a molecular army in rigid formation.But glass is ... none of the above. It is rigid like a solid, but its molecules are not arranged in repeating crystals. It is amorphous like a liquid.\n  \n  In fact, structurally there is no sharp line between a liquid and a glass. You form glass by \u2018super cooling\u201d a liquid below its freezing point, then cooling it some more. If you cool it fast enough, the molecules can\u2019t organize themselves into crystals. As the temperature drops, the liquid becomes more viscous and the molecules more sluggish. It\u2019s like a game of molecular musical chairs in which the music never stops and the players never sit down; instead they seem to move through honey, then tar, until they are all but motionless, like bugs in amber.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7533#7534", "answerId": "7534"}
{"question": "Does Ebola pose \"little risk to the U.S. general population\"?", "questionId": "22638", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22638", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "The WHO website has some good information about Ebola. In particular,\n\n\n  Ebola then spreads in the community through human-to-human transmission, with infection resulting from direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and indirect contact with environments contaminated with such fluids. Burial ceremonies in which mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased person can also play a role in the transmission of Ebola. Men who have recovered from the disease can still transmit the virus through their semen for up to 7 weeks after recovery from illness.\n  \n  Health-care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed EVD. This has occurred through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced.\n\n\nand a little later on\n\n\n  It is not always possible to identify patients with EBV early because initial symptoms may be non-specific. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients \u2013 regardless of their diagnosis \u2013 in all work practices at all times. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment (according to the risk of splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices and safe burial practices.\n  \n  Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus should apply, in addition to standard precautions, other infection control measures to avoid any exposure to the patient\u2019s blood and body fluids and direct unprotected contact with the possibly contaminated environment. When in close contact (within 1 metre) of patients with EBV, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).\n\n\nNews articles have also reported other important information:\n\n\n  The spread of the disease is worsened by mistrust of western medicine in some African communities\n  \n  Some believe the outbreak is a hoax - or even that health workers are killing patients.\n  \n  But Dr Walsh says any cases that reached Britain would be far more manageable. He says: \u201cEbola is pretty containable with modern methods in modern countries. You won\u2019t see a major outbreak in the UK.\u201d\n\n\nIn summary, Ebola is scary because it has the potential to become a pandemic that kills millions or even billions of people as it can spread easily from person to person. However, it can only spread through direct contact. If people know this, then it is easy to prevent it from spreading.\n\nThe reason it has spread so much already is, as news articles have reported, that the people of the region do not believe what they are being told. That means they continue to engage in unsafe behaviors, such as burial rituals in which they touch the body of someone who died of Ebola.\n\nIf anyone in the US was diagnosed with Ebola then there would be quarantines put in place to completely isolate everyone who had come in contact with the person diagnosed. Also, anyone who began to show any symptoms of being sick would immediately be quarantined and tested for Ebola. Ebola is not contagious before symptoms begin to show, so these measures would effectively prevent any further spread.\n\nMore\n\nFrom another news article:\n\n\n  Symptoms include fever, headache, diarrhea and vomiting. Some patients have trouble breathing.\n  \n  Doctors are asking patients with these symptoms if they have traveled recently to the three countries primarily affected by the Ebola outbreak: Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. They're also asking if patients have been in contact with anyone else who has traveled to the region lately.\n  \n  [Dr. Eric Legome, chief of emergency medicine at Kings County Hospital in New York] said hospitals have a low threshold to isolate patients, meaning anyone who is even remotely suspected of being infected will immediately be put in an isolated ICU room so health officials can run tests.\n\n\nAlso, this article does a decent job of explaining how containing Ebola has about as much to do with sociology as it is does epidemiology.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nWe now have a case of a man being diagnosed with Ebola while being in the United States, and he has just died. Because he was showing symptoms for multiple days before being diagnosed and quarantined, it is possible that he infected some of the people that he came in contact with. Within Ebola's incubation period of 21 days (October 29th, 2014), if anyone was infected they will begin showing symptoms. 21 days after those people recover (late November 2014) we will be able to know if those people infected any additional people. This will give us a good idea of how well the US healthcare system is able to handle Ebola, at least for small numbers of people infected.\n\nUpdate (Oct 20th):\n\nAs of today 43 people are no longer being monitored, including the family of the man who died. Two nurses who took care of him were infected and are being treated. Within about 21 days we will know whether or not there will be any additional infections.\n\nAlso, Nigeria has been declared free of Ebola. That article also mentions that Nigeria \"has a robust health care system\" already and did a good job of tracking the \"nearly 900 people who were potentially exposed to Ebola\". As a result, there were only 20 confirmed cases of Ebola in Nigeria.\n\nIf you read articles about what is being done in the United States, you'll frequently see them mention that the people who were exposed to Ebola are being monitored, such as the 43 people who are now known to not be infected. This suggests that the U.S. is doing a good job of containing Ebola, further strengthening the claim that the disease poses \"little risk to the U.S. general population\".\n\nUpdate (Nov 6th):\n\nThere have been no additional infections from the case in Dallas. As of today, there is only one person who is still being monitored, and tomorrow will pass the maximum incubation period of Ebola.\n\nThe cases of Ebola in Texas have given us what we previously lacked - evidence of whether or not an outbreak could be prevented. Even though Thomas Duncan (the man who died) was not quarantined while he was symptomatic, not a single member of the general public was infected by him or by the two nurses he did infect.\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to read a humorous article about why we don't need to worry, Cracked just did an article on it.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22638#22639", "answerId": "22639"}

Either because nudity equals sex (while in Hollywood, this appears to generally be the case - it's extremely rare to see a nude scene that isn't purely for titillation, rather than because someone just woke up or got out of the shower), or because it hadn't occurred to them that they might be separate.\n\nIf you want to know if social nudity - namely nudity that is purely nonsexual - has any effect on children, just ask a nudist.\n\nThis document explains one nudist club's stance on the effects of social nudity on children, and cites several studies. The conclusion they reach is that there is absolutely no negative effect, and there may be a positive effect on the psyche. The basic nudist philosophy is that the extreme modesty of the Victorian era was in fact harmful (which was proven by many studies before and since), and as such, perhaps its inverse - a total lack of modesty - is beneficial.\n\nStudies aside, nudists themselves have observed no obvious negative effects in children - very young children especially like to be naked, and generally the idea that there's nothing inherently wrong with the human body in its natural state promotes better body image in older children as well. See the bottom of the document above about Casler's study, and the older children's reactions in his interviews. \n\nIt's generally parents' negative reactions to nudity in TV and film that are most harmful to children. Especially if that reaction is particularly unhinged and panicked - see also: \n\nSuper Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy\n\nEdit:\n\nThere was a paper written on this subject (actually, of children witnessing parental nudity and sexual activity, which of course, is different from what you see on TV, since parents have such a central and authoritative role in a child's life) in the Journal of Sex Research. The paper can be found on here.\n\n\n  Consistent with the\n  cross-sectional retrospective literature (and with our expectations), no harmful main\n  effects of these experiences were found at age 17-18. Indeed, trends in the data that were\n  significant at p [less than] 0.05 but did not reach significance following the Bonferonni\n  correction indicated primarily beneficial correlates of both of these variables. Exposure to\n  parental nudity was associated with positive, rather than negative, sexual experiences in\n  adolescence, but with reduced sexual experience overall. Boys exposed to parental nudity\n  were less likely to have engaged in theft in adolescence or to have used various\n  psychedelic drugs and marijuana.\n  \n  Taken as a whole then, effects are few, but generally beneficial in nature. Thus, results of\n  this study add weight to the views of those who have opposed alarmist characterizations\n  of childhood exposure both to nudity and incidental scenes of parental sexuality.\n\n\nThis is very likely the kind of thing (historically speaking, of course, which the paper touches on) that the MPAA and the government bases such things upon. Mostly this seems to harken back to Freud and early students thereof, who assumed that nearly every psychological disorder originated from witnessing such things as a small child.

Today, a child can easily work with the left hand. Thanks to some tools such as scissors, writing pads and pens for left-handed no problems are expected. If a child does have bad deal, because it has, for example, an unfavorable position when writing, there are recognized and specially-trained occupational therapists who can help.\n\nWhat does switching accomplish?\n\nSo like you can read in the article \"Can Left-Handedness be Switched? Insights from an Early Switch of Handwriting\" from The Journal of Neuroscience, 18 July 2007:\n\n\n  These results suggest two distinct neuronal correlates of handedness\n  in human sensorimotor cortex. Although those in executive sensorimotor\n  cortex (i.e., SM1 and adjacent PMd) depend on the hand used throughout\n  life, those in higher-order sensorimotor areas (i.e., inferior\n  parietal cortex and rostrolateral PMd) are invariant and thus cannot\n  be switched to the nondominant hemisphere by educational training.\n\n\nWhich says that the areas that are directly involved in movement control will move increasingly to the left in the brain, which is the dominant half in right-handers. But the larger regions that participate in the planning and control of movement remain all life in the same place.\n\nParadoxly those planning and control areas were even more stressed in retrained persons than in normal left-handers.\n\nProblems of switching?\n\nEven as early as 1918 [1] observations were made, were\n\n\n  [retraining]... may result in speech-hesitation. [...] Taking it all in all, this investigation seems proof conclusive that left-handed children should not be forced to use the right hand.\n\n\nAnd a lot more studies from that time period (1930s) were linking stuttering to forced left-hand retrainment. \n\nBut since then no more professional studies have been made to investigate eventual problems with retrainment[2]. One of the reason for that is that left-handedness was long seen as a deviation from the norm and medical treatment or research was conducted purely from this perspective. \nAlso many studies provide statements that refer to very different groups of people: generally assessed left-handed people, learned left handed and the subgroup of trauma-induced left-handed were all mixed together and no reasonable conclusions can be made.\n\nSummary\n\nSo while it is not proven at this point that retraining is leading to serious problems (apart from the increased brain load) there are is also no point in doing it.

Among 34 women who had intercourse on Days \u22125 to \u22122 of the fertile period and took ECP before or on the day of ovulation, four pregnancies could have been expected, but none were observed.\n\n\nIn \"Contraceptive efficacy of emergency contraception with levonorgestrel given before or after ovulation\", 2010 [2]:\n\n\n  Among the 103 women who took LNG-EC before ovulation (days \u22125 to \u22121), 16 pregnancies were expected and no pregnancy occurred (p&lt;.0001). Among the 45 women who took LNG-EC on the day of ovulation (day 0) or thereafter, 8 pregnancies occurred and 8.7 were expected (p=1.00). \n\n\n2. The product labeling does not reflect evidence showing that levonorgestrel does prevent implantation by some identifiable mechanism; only uncertainty about whether or not it could.\n\nWhy did anybody ever think that Plan B inhibits implantation of fertilized eggs?\n\nThe labeling of Plan B (which in the US, must be approved by the FDA) says:\n\n\n  Plan B One-Step is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization (by altering tubal transport of sperm and/or ova). In addition, it may inhibit implantation (by altering the endometrium). It is not effective once the process of implantation has begun.\n\n\nMany point to this as evidence that Plan B inhibits implantation.\n\nHowever, it's not clear that there was ever any direct evidence that levonorgestrel affects implantation. The New York Times claims that at the time that Plan B was going through FDA approval, \n\n\n  Experts say implantation was likely placed on the label partly because daily birth control pills, some of which contain Plan B\u2019s active ingredient, appear to alter the endometrium, the lining of the uterus into which fertilized eggs implant. \n\n\nand \n\n\n  Implantation also likely wound up on the label because of what Dr. Gemzell-Danielsson called wishful thinking by some scientists, who thought that if it could also block implantation, it would be even better at preventing pregnancy.\n\n\nIn 2005, when the FDA reviewed Plan B in order to make it available without prescription in some cases, the manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, asked for the statement about implantation to be removed from the label. According to the NYT again,\n\n\n  Addressing the issue in a 2005 memorandum, Dr. Steven Galson, director of the F.D.A.\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, wrote that studies \u201cconclusively demonstrate\u201d that Plan B\u2019s ability to block ovulation, is \u201cresponsible for most, if not all, instances in which emergency contraception prevents pregnancy.\u201d But he also said that studies at that time could not exclude the possibility the pills impeded implantation \u201cin a small percentage of women.\u201d He declined a request to be interviewed.\n\n\n3. The main mechanism by which it was once thought that levonorgestrel might prevent implantation is by affecting the endometrium, but studies later suggest that levonorgestrel has no meaningful effect on endometrial receptivity.\n\nIn both in vitro studies and studies on humans, levonorgestrel has no effect on endometrial receptivity when administered in an emergency contraception dose.\n\nFrom \"Effect of levonorgestrel and mifepristone on endometrial receptivity markers in a three-dimensional human endometrial cell culture model\", 2009 [3]:\n\n\n  This in vitro model expresses progesterone-regulated endometrial receptivity factors seen in the physiologic condition. Treatment with levonorgestrel did not affect the expression of these endometrial receptivity markers in contrast to mifepristone.\n\n\nFrom \"A single midcycle dose of levonorgestrel similar to emergency contraceptive does not alter the expression of the L-selectin ligand or molecular markers of endometrial receptivity\", 2010 [4]:\n\n\n  Objective\n  \n  To examine the effects of a single-dose of 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel (commonly used as emergency contraceptive) on endometrial receptivity biomarkers through the oral or vaginal route.\n  \n  ...\n  \n  Result(s)\n  \n  Plasma progesterone concentration and endometrial dating were not different. The pattern of progesterone receptors and glycodelin-A expression was not affected during the early and midsecretory phase. Some endometrial biopsies from the group in which levonorgetrel was orally administered showed areas of glandular atrophy and stromal decidualization. However, the expression of the progesterone receptor, L-selectin ligand, \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, and glycodelin-A were not different between the groups.\n  \n  Conclusion(s)\n  \n  Levonorgestrel, given as emergency contraceptive on the day of LH surge, does not disrupt either ovulation or progesterone production by the corpus luteum. The contraceptive mechanism of levonorgestrel at the time of LH surge does not include changes in the progesterone receptors or the endometrial receptivity biomarkers.\n\n\nRegarding that \"areas of glandular atrophy and stromal decidualization\" thing, they further clarify:\n\n\n  In our study, the endometrial biopsies from the LNG-EC-treated subjects administered by the oral route showed areas of irregular development that were characterized by glandular atrophy and intense stromal decidualization. This morphologic change resembles the prolonged and intense effect of progestin on the endometrium. Interestingly, according to the HSCORE evaluation, neither the PR expression nor the endometrial molecular markers were affected compared with the normal endometrial tissue. Our work confirms the finding of Murray et al. (25), which demonstrates endometrial histology is not a valid method for evaluating endometrial receptivity. This finding indicates that endometrial morphology is insufficient to predict the endometrial molecular receptivity phenotype and the capability of the uterus to support embryo implantation.\n\n\nIn \"Effects of oral and vaginal administration of levonorgestrel emergency contraception on markers of endometrial receptivity\", 2010 [5]: \n\n\n  METHODS Endometrial biopsies were taken from non-smoking, healthy women with proven fertility on cycle days LH + 6 to LH + 8 in control and levonorgestrel treatment cycles (each woman serving as her own control). Levonorgestrel was administered either orally (0.75 mg \u00d7 4, at 24 h intervals on LH + 1 to LH + 4; n = 8) or vaginally (a single dose of 1.5 mg on LH + 2; n = 7). Immunohistochemistry and real-time RT\u2013PCR was performed to compare the levels of protein and mRNA for sex steroid receptors, interleukin-1\u03b2, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclooxygenase-2, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and mucin 1 in endometrial cells.\n  \n  RESULTS Following the repeated oral treatment, the immunoreactivity of both progesterone receptor (PR)-A and PR-B declined in glandular epithelium (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively), whereas stromal immunoreactivity and mRNA expression of LIF increased compared with control (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). However, vaginal levonorgestrel did not cause any significant endometrial changes.\n  \n  CONCLUSIONS The two regimens of levonorgestrel caused either only minor or no alterations in markers of endometrial receptivity. New agents targeting the endometrial development should be explored in order to increase EC efficacy.\n\n\nAnd in \"On the mechanisms of action of short-term levonorgestrel administration in emergency contraception\", 2001 [6]:\n\n\n  The effects of short-term administration of levonorgestrel (LNG) at different stages of the ovarian cycle on the pituitary-ovarian axis, corpus luteum function, and endometrium were investigated. Forty-five surgically sterilized women were studied during two menstrual cycles. In the second cycle, each women received two doses of 0.75 mg LNG taken 12 h apart on day 10 of the cycle (Group A), at the time of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) surge (Group B), 48 h after positive detection of urinary LH (Group C), or late follicular phase (Group D). In both cycles, transvaginal ultrasound and serum LH were performed from the detection of urinary LH until ovulation. Serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) were measured during the complete luteal phase. In addition, an endometrial biopsy was taken at day LH + 9. Eighty percent of participants in Group A were anovulatory, the remaining (three participants) presented significant shortness of the luteal phase with notably lower luteal P4 serum concentrations. In Groups B and C, no significant differences on either cycle length or luteal P4 and E2 serum concentrations were observed between the untreated and treated cycles. Participants in Group D had normal cycle length but significantly lower luteal P4 serum concentrations. Endometrial histology was normal in all ovulatory-treated cycles. It is suggested that interference of LNG with the mechanisms initiating the LH preovulatory surge depends on the stage of follicle development. Thus, anovulation results from disrupting the normal development and/or the hormonal activity of the growing follicle only when LNG is given preovulatory. In addition, peri- and post-ovulatory administration of LNG did not impair corpus luteum function or endometrial morphology.\n\n\n4. It is not clear whether levonorgestrel has any effect on pregnancy if administered shortly before ovulation, and if it does, it is not clear by what mechanism.\n\nAny remaining controversy (such as in [7]; note that this is published in  the journal of the Catholic Medical Association) revolves around whether levonorgestrel is effective at preventing pregnancy if administered shortly before ovulation, and if so, by what mechanism.\n\nLevonorgestrel does not seem to prevent or delay ovulation (\"follicular rupture\") when administered shortly before ovulation. For example, from a study comparing levonorgestrel (LNG) and another emergency contraceptive, ulipristal acetate (UPA), \"Ulipristal acetate prevents ovulation more effectively than levonorgestrel: analysis of pooled data from three randomized trials of emergency contraception regimens\", 2013, [8]:\n\n\n  Forty eight LNG-treated (1.5 mg) cycles, 31 LNG (1.5 mg) + meloxicam (15 mg), 34 UPA (30 mg) cycles and 50 placebo cycles were compared. Follicle rupture was delayed for at least 5 days in 14.6%, 38.7%, 58.8% and 4% of the LNG-, LNG+meloxicam-, UPA- and placebo-treated cycles, respectively. UPA was more effective than LNG and placebo in inhibiting follicular rupture (p=.0001), while LNG, when administered at this time of the cycle, was not different than placebo. The addition of meloxicam improved the efficacy of LNG in preventing follicular rupture (p=.0292 vs. LNG; p=.0001 vs. placebo; non-significant vs. UPA). UPA was effective in preventing rupture in the 5 days following treatment, even when administered at the time of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge (UPA 79%, LNG 14% and placebo 10%). None of the treatments were effective when administered on the day of the LH peak. The median time from treatment to rupture was 6 days during the ulipristal cycles and 2 days in the placebo and LNG/LNG+meloxicam cycles (p=.0015).\n  \n  Although no EC treatment is 100% effective in inhibiting follicular rupture when administered in the late follicular phase, UPA is the most effective treatment, delaying ovulation for at least 5 days in 59% of the cycles. LNG is not different from placebo in inhibiting follicular rupture at this advanced phase of the cycle. No treatment was effective in postponing rupture when administered on the day of LH peak.\n\n\nIf levonorgestrel does not prevent ovulation when administered at this late stage, what accounts for its effectiveness in this period? Well, first, it's not at all clear that it is effective when administered just before ovulation. For example, in another study comparing the effectiveness of levonorgestrel (which does not prevent ovulation when administered just before ovulation) and ulipristal acetate (which does), ulipristal acetate was more effective at preventing pregnancy. From \"Ulipristal acetate versus levonorgestrel for emergency contraception: a randomised non-inferiority trial and meta-analysis\", 2010 [9]:\n\n\n  In the efficacy-evaluable population, 1696 women received emergency contraception within 72 h of sexual intercourse (ulipristal acetate, n=844; levonorgestrel, n=852). There were 15 pregnancies in the ulipristal acetate group (1\u00b78%, 95% CI 1\u00b70\u20133\u00b70) and 22 in the levonorgestrel group (2\u00b76%, 1\u00b77\u20133\u00b79; odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b735\u20131\u00b731). In 203 women who received emergency contraception between 72 h and 120 h after sexual intercourse, there were three pregnancies, all of which were in the levonorgestrel group. \n\n\nIt is also difficult to \"account\" for the effectiveness of pregnancy prevention measures (and determine whether known mechanism explain all of the effectiveness). First, this involves predicting how many pregnancies would have been expected without intervention, and the statistical models for this are sometimes unreliable. For example, in [10], some pregnancies occurred in women for whom \"the risk of conception was theoretically nil\" according to the standard model. Also, many studies measuring effectiveness of interventions under various conditions rely on women's own reports of the timing of their menstrual cycle, which is prone to error compared to other, more invasive, means [2].\n\nOther studies suggest that levonorgestrel may have some effect on the ovulatory process even in cases where it is administered too late to prevent ovulation. For example, in \"Pituitary\u2013ovarian function following the standard levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive dose or a single 0.75-mg dose given on the days preceding ovulation\", 2004 [11]:\n\n\n  We assessed to what extent the standard dose of levonorgestrel (LNG), used for emergency contraception, or a single dose (half dose), given in the follicular phase, affects the ovulatory process during the ensuing 5-day period. Fifty-eight women were divided into three groups according to timing of treatment. Each woman contributed with three treatment cycles separated by resting cycles. All received placebo in one cycle, and standard or single dose in two other cycles, in a randomized order. The diameter of the dominant follicle determined the time of treatment. Each woman had the same diameter assigned for all her treatments. Diameters were grouped into 33 categories: 12\u201314, 15\u201317 or 18\u201320 mm. Follicular rupture failed to occur during the 5-day period in 44%, 50% and 36% of cycles with the standard, half dose and placebo, respectively. Ovulatory dysfunction, characterized by follicular rupture associated with absent, blunted or mistimed gonadotropin surge, occurred in 35%, 36% and 5% of standard, single dose or placebo cycles, respectively. In conclusion, LNG can disrupt the ovulatory process in 93% of cycles treated when the diameter of the dominant follicle is between 12 and 17 mm. It is highly probable that this mode of action fully accounts for the contraceptive efficacy as well as the failure rate of this method. The present data suggest that half the dose may be as effective as the standard dose.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Novikova, N., Weisberg, E., Stanczyk, F.Z., Croxatto, H.B. and Fraser, I.S., 2007.

There is no scientific consensus that sufficiently low doses of ionising radiation are unsafe.\n\nFirst, you have two different claims here. \n\n\n\"Scientists agree that Linear No Threshold (LNT) is valid at all doses\"\n\"Scientists agree that Radiation Hormesis is wrong\"\n\n\nThe Radiation Hormesis hypothesis states that low doses of ionising radiation can be beneficial, while a model where below a certain level ionising radiation simply has no discernible influence is something else.\n\nBut we can cut the Gordian Knot here by simply answering: \n\nNo, there is not consensus that LNT can be used to estimate an actual physical effect of ionising radiation at low dosages. The Wikipedia article you linked to describes the \"controversy\" about this. There are those that oppose using LNT as a tool for judging damage made by low dose radiation:\n\n\nThe French Academy of Sciences (Acade\u0301mie des Sciences) and the National Academy of Medicine (Acade\u0301mie Nationale de Me\u0301decine) published a report in 2005 that rejected the Linear no-threshold model in favor of a threshold dose response and a significantly reduced risk at low radiation exposure  Reference. Reference.\n\n\n  In conclusion, this report raises doubts on the validity of using LNT for evaluating the carcinogenic risk of low doses (&lt; 100 mSv) and even more for very low doses (&lt; 10 mSv). The LNT concept can be a useful pragmatic tool for assessing rules in radioprotection for doses above 10 mSv; however since it is not based on biological concepts of our current knowledge, it should not be used without precaution for assessing by extrapolation the risks associated with low and even more so, with very low doses (&lt; 10 mSv), especially for benefit-risk assessments imposed on radiologists by the European directive 97-43.\n\nThe Health Physics Society 's position statement first adopted in January 1996, as revised in July 2010, states:\n\n\n  In accordance with current knowledge of radiation health risks, the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risks below an individual dose of 5 rem (50 mSv) in one year or a lifetime dose of 10 rem (100 mSv) above that received from natural sources. Doses from natural background radiation in the United States average about 0.3 rem (3 mSv) per year. A dose of 5 rem (50 mSv) will be accumulated in the first 17 years of life and about 25 rem (250 mSv) in a lifetime of 80 years. Estimation of health risk associated with radiation doses that are of similar magnitude as those received from natural sources should be strictly qualitative and encompass a range of hypothetical health outcomes, including the possibility of no adverse health effects at such low levels.\n\nThe American Nuclear Society recommended further research on the Linear No Threshold Hypothesis before making adjustments to current radiation protection guidelines, concurring with the Health Physics Society's position that:\n\n\n  There is substantial and convincing scientific evidence for health risks at high dose. Below 10 rem or 100 mSv (which includes occupational and environmental exposures) risks of health effects are either too small to be observed or are non-existent.\n\n\n\nSo...\n\nNo there is not consensus, there are those that claim LNT is valid for low doses, and those that say it is not. \n\nCommentary\n\nThis does not mean that there is consensus that Radiation Hormesis is correct either, but that is a separate discussion.\n\nThe reason there is this debate is because \u2014 once the radiation dose drops low enough \u2014 other carcinogenic factors glare out the effects of ionising radiation, and cause the latter to get lost in statistical noise. It is like trying to hear a whisper in a crowd when everyone else is shouting.\n\nWhile we cannot say for certain that LNT reflects reality at low doses, it may still be used a tool for determining policy. But even in that role it is contested since determining policy after minuscule doses may cause radiophobia and/or unnecessary bureaucratic hassle, but that is another discussion.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/39804#42042", "answerId": "42042"}

For any type of claim at this regard to be at least meaningful very precise distinctions have to be made and extreme care has to be made before doing any generalization (i.e.: if a compound helps relieving symptoms of arthritis, this does not imply it will help for inflammatory bowel syndrome).\n\nIn summary: there seems to be a possible acute effect of &omega;3 PUFA on certain inflammatory situations. Evidence of prevention of inflammatory diseases is scarce at least. In certain cases such as prostate cancer certain PUFA may however be a risk factor.\n\nFurther studies are warranted before being able to give a precise answer on this.\n\n\n\nHere are few examples of studies to support this conclusion\n\nThis article gives a meta analysis of clinical trials on the role of &omega;3 in joint pain relieve.\n\nA meta-analysis of the analgesic effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for inflammatory joint pain. - Goldberg and Katz - Pain, 2007\n\nThey conclude that there may be an effect in decreasing certain symptoms.\n\n\n  We conducted a meta-analysis of 17 randomized, controlled trials assessing the pain relieving effects of omega-3 PUFAs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or joint pain secondary to inflammatory bowel disease and dysmenorrhea\n  [...]\n  Supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs for 3-4 months reduces patient reported joint pain intensity (SMD: -0.26; 95% CI: -0.49 to -0.03, p=0.03), minutes of morning stiffness (SMD: -0.43; 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.15, p=0.003), number of painful and/or tender joints (SMD: -0.29; 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.10, p=0.003), and NSAID consumption (SMD: -0.40; 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.08, p=0.01). Significant effects were not detected for physician assessed pain (SMD: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.49 to 0.22, p=0.45) or Ritchie articular index (SMD: 0.15; 95% CI: -0.19 to 0.49, p=0.40) at 3-4 months. The results suggest that omega-3 PUFAs are an attractive adjunctive treatment for joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and dysmenorrhea.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand this recent study found no effect of &omega;3 in the amelioration of symptoms peripheral arterial disease.\n\nEffect of Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on markers of platelet and endothelial function in patients with peripheral arterial disease. - Mackay et al. - Atherosclerosis., 2012\n\n\n  OBJECTIVE: Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce platelet and endothelial activation in patients with or at risk of cardiac disease. We aimed to determine if Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in addition to best medical therapy can reduce the increased platelet and endothelial activity that is present in patients with intermittent claudication.\n  [...]\n  CONCLUSION: Supplementation with Omega-3 fatty acids had no affect on platelet and endothelial activation or markers of inflammation in patients with peripheral arterial disease.\n\n\n\n\nAnother study showed an amelioration in the inflammatory status of cancer patient with fish oil\n\nFish oil supplement alters markers of inflammatory and nutritional status in colorectal cancer patients. - Silva et al. - Nutr Cancer., 2012\n\n\n  This study aims at investigating whether there are changes in inflammation markers and/or in nutritional status of patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy who were supplemented with fish oil.\n  [...]\n  Low doses of fish oil supplement can positively modulate the nutritional status and the C-reative protein/albumin ratio.\n\n\n\n\nSo, are these studies confirming the claim that &omega;3 \"may help lower risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and arthritis.\"?\n\nDefinitely not. What these and other similar studies show is that they can lower inflammations markers during an already existing inflammatory state. They do not say anything about preventing or lowering the risk of inflammation, let alone of cancer or arthritis.\n\nAt this regard, I could find this study where the effect of &omega;3 on the  risk of prostate cancer were monitored over the course of 7 years.\n\n\n\nSerum phospholipid fatty acids and prostate cancer risk: results from the prostate cancer prevention trial. - Brasky et al. - Am J Epidemiol., 2011\n\n\n  Inflammation may be involved in prostate cancer development and progression. This study examined the associations between inflammation-related phospholipid fatty acids and the 7-year-period prevalence of prostate cancer in a nested case-control analysis of participants, aged 55-84 years, in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial during 1994-2003. Cases (n = 1,658) were frequency matched to controls (n = 1,803) on age, treatment, and prostate cancer family history. Phospholipid fatty acids were extracted from serum, and concentrations of &omega;-3, &omega;-6, and trans-fatty acids (TFAs) were expressed as proportions of the total.\n  [...]\n  No fatty acids were associated with low-grade prostate cancer risk. Docosahexaenoic acid was positively associated with high-grade disease\n  [...]\n  The study findings are contrary to those expected from the pro- and antiinflammatory effects of these fatty acids and suggest a greater complexity of effects of these nutrients with regard to prostate cancer risk.\n\n\n\n\nSimilar conclusions are drawn by this review:\n\nDietary N-6 and N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostate cancer risk: a review of epidemiological and experimental evidence. - Astorg - Cancer Causes Control., 2004\n\n\n  RESULTS: There is no or little evidence of an association of linoleic or arachidonic acids with PCa risk. Most epidemiological studies failed to find an association of PCa risk with fish or long-chain n -3 PUFA intake, but two recent cohort studies did find an inverse association of fish consumption with the risk of the latest stages of PCa. alpha -linolenic acid intake was associated with an increase of PCa risk in a majority of epidemiological studies, but other studies did not find this association. Experimental work in vitro and in vivo, as well as mechanistic studies, support a protective effect of long-chain n -3 PUFA on PCa, but data on the effects of linoleic and alpha -linolenic acids are scarce.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Long-chain n -3 PUFA from fish are possible promising nutrients for the dietary prevention of PCa, but to-date with little epidemiological support. In contrast, studies suggest that alpha -linolenic acid intake might be a risk factor. New work, both epidemiological and experimental, is awaited to clarify these results.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10919#10930", "answerId": "10930"}

The Anonymous Donor has pledged the first $100,000\n  for this project, and we will circulate a proposal to match and then expand upon that investment.\n\n\nHeartland has confirmed this project, though not the details or the level of funding:\n\n\n  We are concerned that schools are teaching climate change issues in a manner that is not consistent with sound science and that is designed to lead students to the erroneous belief that humans are causing a global warming crisis. We hope that our efforts will restore sound science to climate change education and discourage the political propaganda that too often passes as \u201ceducation\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nMany of the details in the Climate Strategy (which was, according to Heartland, faked) also appear in the other documents. The drop in funding from the Anonymous Donor from 2010 to 2011 is documented in the Fourth Quarter Financial Statement [PDF], and the expected increase in the Budget. \n\nThe Climate Strategy states that:\n\n\n  We will also pursue additional support from the Charles G. Koch Foundation. They returned as a Heartland donor in 2011 with a contribution of $200,000. We expect to push up\n  their level of support in 2012 and gain access to their network of philanthropists, if our focus\n  continues to align with their interests\n\n\nHowever, according to the Fundraising Plan, Koch gave $25000 in 2011, with $200,000 projected in 2012.\n\nThe funding to Dr Wojick is also listed in the Fundraising Plan.\n\n\n  We tentatively plan to pay Dr. Wojick $5,000 per module, about $25,000 a quarter, starting in\n  the second quarter of 2012, for this work. The Anonymous Donor has pledged the first $100,000\n  for this project, and we will circulate a proposal to match and then expand upon that investment.\n\n\nThe Climate Strategy lists $388,000 in 2011 funding for the NIPCC, along with monthly payments to Craig Idso, Fred Singer, and Robert Carter. These amounts can all be found in the budget. I could not find any particular mentions of plans to focus more on publishing in Forbes, or of cultivating relationships with Revkin or Curry in the other documents (which are mostly financial in nature, so this is not particularly surprising). Finally, the funding for Anthony Watt's project has, as I mentioned earlier, already been confirmed.\n\n\n\nThe details in the document that is, according to Heartland, faked, contain one detail (the amount of funding from the Koch foundation) which is inconsistent with the other documents, and one (increased focus on Forbes magazine, Andy Revkin and Judith Curry) not found elsewhere. The rest of the details in that document, however, are matched in at least one of the others. Many of these (for example, the funding to Watts) had not previously been publicly available, which is strong reason to believe that whoever authored the Climate Strategy memo had access to the other documents. \n\nSeveral days after the releases, Peter Gleick, a climate scientist at the Pacific Institute, came forward as the person responsible for releasing the documents. According to Gleick, he received the Climate Strategy memo anonymously in the mail and then assumed the identity of a Heartland staffer to solicit documents that could confirm the details. This is consistent with Heartland's statements about how the documents were leaked. \n\nMany of the details revealed in the documents. Seth Borenstein conducted an investigation and confirmed a number of additional details. Again, the results were all in one direction: everyone mentioned in the leaked documents that Borenstein contacted confirmed the information in the documents.\n\n\n  Because Heartland was not specific about what was fake and what was real, The Associated Press attempted to verify independently key parts of separate budget and fundraising documents that were leaked. The federal consultant working on the classroom curriculum, the former TV weatherman, a Chicago elected official who campaigns against hidden local debt and two corporate donors all confirmed to the AP that the sections in the document that pertained to them were accurate. No one the AP contacted said the budget or fundraising documents mentioning them were incorrect.\n\n\nAt this stage, it seems highly unlikely that any of the other documents were altered - Heartland hasn't made any attempt to refute any of the revelations, and they have passed every attempt at verification to date. The Climate Strategy memo, meanwhile, must have been written by someone with access to the other documents - i.e. either Gleick or Heartland. Right now, there isn't enough evidence to say one way or another.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8054#8075", "answerId": "8075"}

This quote is pulled, out of context, from 1982, 37 years ago. We've gotten better at climate science since.)\n\nMilankovitch cycles happen on a scale of tens of thousands of years. And we are indeed in an interglacial warm period. However those long-term cycles do not explain the observed temperature variations in mere decades.\n\n\n\nSource: NASA\n\nFurthermore, the observed changes in solar radiation, 0.05 Watts/m^2, do not match with the change necessary to produce the observed climate change of about 2.8 Watts/m^2.\n\n\n\nSource: IPCC\n\nThese sort of \"gotcha\" articles come from a gross misunderstanding of how climate models work. They disingenuously expect naivety on the part of thousands of climate scientists to not have included something as obvious as Milankovitch cycles in their models while offering no models of their own.\n\nGood climate models contain known natural and human factors. They include radiative forcing, changes in how much energy we receive and retain from the Sun. These include the very well known Milankovitch cycles. The models which exclude human factors do not match our observations. The ones which do include human factors match.\n\n\n\nSource: Union of Concerned Scientists\n\nAs you can see, solar variability is a component of their model and does not explain the recent warming trends of the last couple decades.\n\nThe Union Of Concerned Scientists has this to say about the effect of solar radiation on climate change.\n\n\n  We do know with a good degree of certainty that between 1750-2011, or since the beginning of the industrial period until today, the average increase in energy hitting a given area of the atmosphere (radiative forcing, measured in a unit called watts per square meter) due to heat-trapping gases is 56 times greater (~ 2.83 watts per square meter) than the increase in radiative forcing from the small shift in the sun\u2019s energy (~0.05 watts per square meter).\n  \n  In its Fifth Assessment Report, IPCC scientists evaluated simulations of historical climate variables using a number of numerical models. They first assumed no increase in heat-trapping gases since 1750, so that the temperatures calculated were those that would have been achieved if only solar variability, volcanic eruptions, and other natural climate drivers were included.\n  \n  The temperature results were similar to observed temperatures only for the first half of the century, but the models did not accurately show the general warming trend that has been recorded during the second half of the twentieth century.\n  \n  When computer models include human-induced heat-trapping gases, they accurately reproduce the observed warming during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\n  \n  The evidence shows that although fluctuations in the amount of solar energy reaching our atmosphere do influence our climate, the global warming trend of the past six decades cannot be attributed to changes in the sun.\n\n\nSource: Union of Concerned Scientists\n\nSee Also\n\n\nUnion Of Concerned Scientists: How Does the Sun Affect Our Climate?\nIPCC AR5 Synthesis Report\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44935#44937", "answerId": "44937"}
{"question": "Does evolutionary psychology predict that humans will be more altruistic to those who are similar?", "questionId": "6780", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6780", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Cooperation is far more common than any theory based on \"cooperate with people like you\" would predict\n\nThe trouble with this question is that is is a very big one which others have written whole books about so any summary will be incomplete and perhaps overly simple. \n\nThe most important conclusion is that cooperation between people goes far beyond what Haldane's numbers would predict and that reciprocal altruism base on consanguinity is not a good explanation for actual cooperation. \n\nThere are three key books that describe these ideas well: The Evolution of Cooperation by Robert Axelrod; The selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins; the Origins of Virtue by Matt Ridley (all links to latest editions on Amazon).\n\nHaldane's numbers describe the mathematics of rational cooperation from the point of view of genetic success. It makes sense to display some degree of self sacrifice of an individual if their genes are preserved in the other relatives saved by the sacrifice. The theme of Dawkins' book is working out the implications of that view for biological behaviour. But rather too many people read the title and not the book and somehow never get to the penultimate chapter which (in my edition at least) is called Nice Guys Finish First. The chapter gives a summary of the work of Axelrod. Matt Ridley's book explores this theme in more detail.\n\nWhat Axelrod did provides a powerful illustration that cooperation can be very effective for the individual and the group in ways that are far more significant for real behaviour than preferential behaviour to relatives. His basic idea was to create a computer model of individuals who would compete against each other in interactions with a Prisoner's Dilemma style payoff. The prisoner's dilemma is just about the simplest description of a two player game where the results are not trivial and where something like a real-world tradeoff between short and long term payoffs matters (the rational strategy in a single game is selfish, but if you know you will play repeatedly, you can do much better if you are not selfish). The beauty of the very simple game is how it captures the essence of some real interactions between people where the result is not zero-sum (i.e. the size of the pie can get bigger or smaller depending on how you play so there is more at stake than just what share you get).\n\nAxelrod ran a simulation of many competing strategies for playing the game and ran competitions to see if experts in computer science, game theory and biology could develop effective strategies. The successful algorithms were allowed to grow in number; the less successful killed off in a long game  with many rounds (in modern language he created a simulated ecosystem where individual bots with a particular strategy could recognise other bots they had interacted with before). The critical finding is what sort of strategy is successful in the long term: a selfish one, a greedy one, an altruistic one, a complex one and so on. Naively \"nice\" algorithms get exploited by nasty ones but if the population is all nasty, nasty ones don't do well either. Amazingly one of the simplest algorithms possible often comes out on top: tit-for-tat. It has the characteristics (as described by Dawkins) of\n\n\n  Tit for tat... is 'nice' meaning never the first to defect, and 'forgiving' meaning it has a short memory for past misdeeds. Tit for tat is also 'not envious' ...[which is] to be quite happy if the other player wins just as much money as you do.\n\n\nThere is a lot more detail which I highly recommend people to read, but the key point relevant to this question is just this: Axelrod's simulation demonstrates that cooperative behaviour can emerge from interacting individuals with no concept at all of kin selection (at least if you are playing a non zero-sum game).\n\nMany creatures have the capability to cooperate for mutual benefit with their own species and with entirely different species (e.g. those small birds or fish that clean carnivores' teeth and never get eaten). Many species exhibit self-sacrificial behaviour with non-related individuals. Dawkins ends the description of this by describing mutualistic behaviour in Vampire bats where individuals who have had a good feed will regurgitate blood for unrelated bats who have not had a good feed. he ends the chapter with these words:\n\n\n  Vampires could form the vanguard of a comfortable new myth,a myth of sharing, mutualistic cooperation. They could herald the benignant idea that, even with selfish genes at the helm, nice guys can finish first.\n\n\nThe key point of all this is you don't need to be related to engage in and benefit from cooperative behaviour and that many of the actual examples of cooperation are not derived from the rules about how related we are, but from this, more powerful, drive for mutual benefit.\n\nAnd, perhaps even more importantly for the original question, cooperation doesn't depend on whether the cooperating parties are similar. Otherwise different species couldn't develop symbiotic relationships. The critical issue driving cooperation is repeated interaction between people who recognise each other. This suggests that the correct prediction is that people will be more altruistic to other people they repeatedly interact with and those others may be completely unrelated.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6780#6861", "answerId": "6861"}

Vendors frequently use pictures and testimonials to support their claims, but omit quantitative detail and well-controlled studies. \n\n\nIn this case the description \"how it works\" is quite similar, using physical terms very vaguely, which gives impression of scientific approach to a buyer, but actually tells nothing at all. How it \"increases the solubility of water\"? As the operating principle is different, the magnetic treatment studies are not relevant here and to be absolutely sure it would be necessary to perform a controlled experiment, but from the external similarities I would most likely expect it to be the same, and having no effect at all.\n\nFrom their how it works:\n\n\n  The electronic unit works by sending out a signal which changes the electrical and physical properties of scale forming calcium molecules.\n  \n  This action stops any further build-up of scale by preventing molecules from adhering to themselves or any other surface.\n  \n  The solubility of the water is also increased, therefore existing scale is dissolved back into the water and gradually reduced.\n\n\nAnd more \"scientific\" section (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  The nuclei upon which the crystals start growing are minute in size and have charged surfaces in their natural condition within the water. When they pass through the field, these naturally charged nuclei encounter considerable forces as the field interacts with them.

I travel a lot, having almost traveled on-stop for the last several years.

This page has many interesting points that I think show that people who consider themselves \"travelers\" in some cases consider themselves superior (in travel skills) to \"tourists\".\n\nThat isn't terribly useful without seeing how many people who travel consider themselves travelers as opposed to tourists, although it is interesting to note.\n\nI did find some evidence to indicate that most tourists may consider themselves superior in travel ability relative to their peers.\n\nA study focusing on German tourists in Norway:\n\n\n  German tourists were divided into two groups: those who perceived\n  themselves as typical German tourists and those who did not.

External exposure to radiation often takes the form of burns.  Just as you wouldn't be concerned with \"catching\" sunburn by being close to someone who lingered at the beach too long, you also don't need to worry about \"catching\" radiation burns.  Transference of radioactive particles, which can linger on skin, hair, and clothing, is the only transmission risk.\n\nI think the one of the MAIN stigmas in Japanese culture after the atomic bombings stemmed from  the belief that the children of those exposed to radiation would be born disfigured by horrifying birth defects.  This is especially important in a society where family honor and kinship are so important.  Many would argue that the \"Godzilla\" fear, of monsters born from radiation, is a manifestation of this concern.\n\nFortunately for the Japanese, their fears about the post-bombing effects of radiation being passed on to their kin went mainly unrealized.  As this study shows:\n\n\n  The incidence of major birth defects\n  (594 cases or 0.91%) among the 65,431\n  [births to parents exposed to\n  radiation from the bombings]...accords\n  well with a large series of\n  contemporary Japanese births...where\n  radiation exposure was not involved\n  and overall malformation frequency was\n  0.92%.

I followed its citation chain through http://www.eatwild.com to an actual paper, Rule, D. C., K. S. Brought on, S. M. Shellito, and G. Maiorano. Comparison of Muscle Fatty Acid Profiles and Cholesterol Concentrations of Bison, Beef Cattle, Elk, and Chicken. J Anim Sci 80, no. 5 (2002): 1202-11 which analyzes composition of the meat of these animals:\n\n\n  The objective of this study was to compare fatty acid weight percentages and cholesterol concentrations of longissimus dorsi (LD), semitendinosus (ST), and supraspinatus (SS) muscles (n = 10 for each) of range bison (31 mo of age), feedlot-finished bison (18 mo of age), range beef cows (4 to 7 yr of age), feedlot steers (18 mo of age), free-ranging cow elk (3 to 5 yr of age), and chicken breast...\n  \n  Range-fed animals had higher (P &lt; 0.01) n-3 fatty acids than feedlot-fed animals or chicken breast. Chicken breast n-6 fatty acids were greater (P &lt; 0.01) than for muscles from bison, beef, or elk. Elk had higher (P &lt; 0.01) n-6 fatty acids than bison or beef cattle; however, range-fed animals had higher (P &lt; 0.01) n-6 fatty acids than feedlot-fed animals in [semitendinosus muscles].\n\n\nSo this is a good link between diet and meat composition, and from what I can see there have been several studies confirming the results. Can we find a similar link for dairy products? I dug some more, and according to Couvreur S, Hurtaud C, Lopez C, Delaby L, Peyraud JL. The linear relationship between the proportion of fresh grass in the cow diet, milk fatty acid composition, and butter properties. J Dairy Sci. 2006 Jun;89(6):1956-69, yes:\n\n\n  Milk yield linearly increased with the proportion of fresh grass in the diet (+0.21 kg/d per 10% of grass). Fat yield remained unchanged. Thus, by effect of dilution, increasing the proportion of fresh grass in the diet induced a linear decrease in fat content. Milk fat globule size decreased by 0.29 mum when the proportion of grass reached 30% in the diet. Increasing the proportion of fresh grass in the diet induced a linear increase in unsaturated fatty acids percentages at the expense of saturated fatty acids...\n  \n  Between G0 and G100 [no grass / all corn and all grass / no corn], polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) percentages increased linearly because of the increase in C18:2 n-6 trans trans from 0.25 to 0.61%, C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 from 0.48 to 1.65%, and C18:3n-3 from 0.22 to 0.70%. On the other hand, C18:2 n-6 cis cis tended to decrease linearly. Very long \n  chain PUFA (C20 and C22) were not modified by treatments.\n\n\nHowever:\n\nGermany's Bio-Siegel requirements say nothing about whether you must feed your cows grass. It bans genetically modified food, irradiation, synthetic fertilizers, and requires certain sustainable practices. But as long as you're growing bio-corn on your farm, you can feed it to your cows and still get bio-butter.\n\nA generous interpretation of Greenpeace's results would be that bio-butter manufacturers do some other processing / selection of their products beyond the Bio-Siegel requirements (such as sourcing primarily from grass-fed cows) to increase omega-3 acids, and that's why they got the results they did.

A search for \"starlite\" yielded one article featuring the word \"starlit.\" Not promising.\n\nI then tried International Defence Review. Another search for \"starlite\" turned up only results for something else named \"starlite.\" Furthermore, the magazine is not peer-reviewed, and the article would not have been written by those who actually carried out the tests. I sincerely doubt its reliability.\n\nNow, there could very well be classified records of the experiments. Yet in the article, Ward said,\n\n\n  'They'd been trying to get something to withstand a nuclear flash for 45 years, and we did it in five minutes.' Ward was reluctant to take part at first. 'I was happy with my egg. It was just a challenge and I didn't want to lose.' This was a different league. Starlite-coated eggs were subjected to light-energy sources that simulated a nuclear flash, equivalent to a temperature of 10,000 C. 'They did it twice and it was still there. Charred, but intact.' The Foulness equipment couldn't keep up. 'I said to one scientist, \"Are we doing all right?\", and he burst out laughing. He said, \"Normally, we do a test every couple of hours because we have to wait for it to cool down. We're doing it every 10 minutes, and it's sat there laughing at us.\"'\n\n\nIf the project was so top-secret, there's no way Ward would have been allowed to tell anyone that; The Telegraph would not have been allowed to publish - I'm guessing.\n\nWard also talks about Professor Keith Lewis, who was involved in some of the tests and reportedly told Ward \"that it [starlite] does all sorts of things.\" I have not been able to find anything on Lewis - his university affiliation, his government involvement, or any other details. Searches for the quote lead back to this article.\n\nApparently, NASA was involved:\n\n\n  In June 1991, a sample was sent to White Sands atomic weapons testing site in New Mexico, in the care of the SAS, and subjected to a simulated nuclear onslaught. 'It was classed as the biggest bang in town. I've seen a video [on which] it shredded forest to sawdust, rolled some tanks around, stripped an aircraft into pieces.'\n\n\nEven more interestingly,\n\n\n  spokesman Rudi Narangor revealing that 'We have done a lot of evaluation and ... we know all the tremendous possibilities that this material has.'\n\n\nThe quote has nothing to back it up. A search on NASA for \"Narangor\" yields nothing . . . because the name is actually \"Naranjor.\" Searches for this turn of no results. I'm inclined to believe that if the test ever took place, the results are classified . . . which doesn't explain Naranjor and his quote.\n\nP_s pointed out a document request made to NASA by Michael Anthony Greshko. In it, he asks for documents relating to starlite, Ward and Naranjor. In return, he received two replies from Judi Hoolingsworth.\n\nThe first includes this:\n\n\n  Unfortunately, Rudi Naranjor is no longer employed by NASA and Headquarters email records from either time period you requested do not exist.\n\n\nThe second is along the same lines. No documents related to Naranjor or that supposed test are accessible to the public. This, though appears to be Naranjo, but the page is \"In Memory of a friend.\"\n\n\n\nI am by no means an expert, and so just because I was unable to find anything doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. But there is nothing in the public records of any of the agencies that supposedly tested starlite, which is suspicious. I would actually be very surprised if anything about those tests in The Telegraph was true, because it seems ridiculous that governments would allow something as valuable as this become public. But that's merely opinion. The facts seem to be nonexistent here, and so it appears that starlite has not been tested by a reliable independent, outside source, or that any of the claims made by Ward in the article are true.\n\n\n\nThe claim about the AWE laser test seemed at first to be referring to their Orion laser facility. The article claims that starlite was tested at 10,000 degrees Celsius. Orion has a capacity of 10 million degrees (I'm guessing that's in Celsius, too, but that's huge on any scale). However, the AWE also mentions the HELEN laser, which was operational for 25 years and was possibly used in the experiment described. Indeed, this paper from 1996 indicates that HELEN was operational in 1991 and was most likely the one used. This notes that HELEN can achieve temperatures in excess of 100eV, which, using this conversion, is well over 10,000 degrees Celsius. It appears, therefore, that the claimed temperature was achievable.\n\nI have yet to find information about the alleged RSRE laser.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22956#26427", "answerId": "26427"}

Despite the news report's wording, there's no conclusive evidence that the compounds extracted from tea are healthy, as stated in daniel's answer; this position seems to be shared by the researchers who describe the health benefits as \"potential\".\n\nThe quoted author publishes a separate paper discussing links to health benefits, but he also publishes a third paper that says that caffeine can have a negative impact on some people.  The paper on potential health benefits also discusses potential health hazards.\n\nOverall, the researchers are reporting that microwaving tea can help increase the amount of several of the chemicals of interest by about ~20% vs. their baseline preparation method.  It appears that the researchers suspect that one of these chemicals, catechins, is potentially quite desirable, and this suspicion seems to form the cornerstone of their interest in human health.\n\n\n\nHealth benefits not claimed; merely potential\n\nThe paper that this news story is based on appears to be \"Improved extraction of green tea components from teabags using the microwave oven\" (2012), Quan Vuong et al..\n\nIts abstract begins:\n\n\n  Abstract\n   The green tea (Camellia sinensis) catechins are strong antioxidants linked with potential health benefits. Based on previous studies, it was hypothesised that the typical household conditions for brewing green tea in a teabag \u2013 200 mL freshly boiled water for 2\u20133 min, as per the manufacturers\u2019 instructions \u2013 were not sufficient to extract all the catechins and that a household microwave oven could be used to improve the extraction.\n\n\nSo, from that first line, the authors claim that these compounds in green tea have \"potential health benefits\"; they don't actually make the claim that they do have health benefits.\n\nPossible health benefits explored in separate paper\n\nSeparately, in \"Epidemiological Evidence Linking Tea Consumption to Human Health: A Review\" (2012) by Quan Vuong (and him only, as opposed to with a group of others as in the prior paper):\n\n\n  Abstract\n  \n  Tea has been widely consumed around the world for thousands of years and drinking tea is a daily habit for people of all ages. Tea is a major source of flavanoids, which have become well known as antioxidants. Tea also contains caffeine and theanine, which have been found to associate with health benefits. Many animal and epidemiological studies have been conducted to investigate the link between tea consumption and human health. However, common questions that arise about tea consumption include: whether all teas are the same, why drinking tea is linked with health benefits, how do the different ways of tea preparation impact on availability of tea components, how much and how long a person should consume tea to obtain health benefits, and whether there is any negative health effect associated with drinking tea. To answer these questions, this paper outlines the tea components and their link to human health, discusses major factors affecting availability of tea components in a tea cup, and reviews the latest epidemiological evidence linking tea consumption to human health.\n\n\nAn analysis and characterization of the links and evidence is beyond the scope of this answer, however it's probably sufficient to say that the paper includes:\n\n\n  Several epidemiology studies have reported the association between tea consumption and health benefits. However, the volume of tea required for obtaining health benefits is an area of speculation.\n\n\nSince the original paper was about increasing the effective amount of chemicals released by tea by ~20%, the health benefits would seem to material if that ~20% is the difference in a volume that's less healthy vs. a volume that's more healthy; and as the authors say that'd fall into \"an area of speculation\".\n\nIn this paper's conclusions section:\n\n\n  Results from epidemiological studies were inconsistent and thus it is difficult to conclude how much of tea a day and how long a person should consume tea to obtain the health benefits.\n\n\nCaffeinated tea can be unhealthy for some\n\nThe same author goes on to publish \"Caffeine in Green Tea: Its Removal and Isolation\" (2013) by Quan Vuong and Paul Roach, in which the abstract begins:\n\n\n  Abstract\n   Green tea is a rich source of the strong antioxidants, the catechins, but it also contains high levels of caffeine, which may cause negative effects in some people and this has led to a demand for decaffeinated green tea.\n\n\nSince the first paper claims that microwaving increases the amount of caffeine released from 76% to 92%, it stands to reason that microwaving tea can make it less healthy for some.\n\nOther potential issues\n\nThe second paper cited above, on the potential health benefits of tea, also discusses some of the potential negative impacts (beyond that of caffeine).  Figure 1 from that paper shows a pathway to potentially increased cancer rates, while they also discuss the potential for the sugars in tea to contribute to diabetes.

The American Institute of Physics translates every article in this journal into English, so you can read about his experiment in \"Two-photon-excited luminescence of solid-state DNA\", Quantum Electronics 24.6 (1994), and \"Two-photon-excited luminescence of genetic structures\", Quantum Electronics 26.2 (1996).

Bigger fish IE sharks will probably be more efficient still but I suppose it is hard to perform experiments on them. \n\nRegarding cycling, the problem is that the mass actually has only a minor effect on the pedaling efficiency on flat ground.

{"question": "Does eating just before sleeping cause nightmares?", "questionId": "2111", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2111", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "According to Medline Plus, eating right before bed can increase your metabolism and increase your brain's overnight activity, leading to dreams and nightmares. \n\nSubstances such as alcohol and nicotine cause a lighter sleep and prevent REM sleep, which decreases dreaming. However, some foods may increase REM sleep, which increases dreaming.\n\nThe British cheese board (remarkably it does exist) conducted a \"study\" giving 200 people cheese at most 30 mins before bed and found that 67% (130 odd) remembered their dreams the following day. There was no control in this publicity stunt study (though it was endorsed by a sleep scientist at the University of Surrey) so there is no way of nothing if that is an increase or a decrease from normal rates of dream recall.\n\nSo I would say it is possible that eating certain foods might increase your chances of dream recall upon waking. Though with the caevet that this could just be down to cultural expectations that lead people to expect to dream and therefore they \"remember\" dreams when they wake up. Though Richard Wiseman ran an experiment on this and a fair number of commenters who would have expected to dream failed to recall any dreams.\n\nIn short: more research is needed but it's possible and may even be plausible depending on the food being consumed.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2111#10786", "answerId": "10786"}

The greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide was first measured in 1859.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n  In the 19th century, scientists realized that gases in the atmosphere cause a \"greenhouse effect\" which affects the planet's temperature. These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. They found that the gas plays a crucial role in climate change, so that the rising level could gravely affect our future.\n\n\n&mdash;The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect\n\n\nsource\n\nFarming\n\nAnother man-made source is the direct emission of greenhouse gasses through farming (funny, but true!): manure (and cows) produce methane which is a pretty effective greenhouse gas.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n  Increasing atmospheric concentrations of methane have led scientists to examine its sources of origin. Ruminant livestock can produce 250 to 500 L of methane per day. This level of production results in estimates of the contribution by cattle to global warming that may occur in the next 50 to 100 yr to be a little less than 2%.\n\n\n&mdash;Methane emissions from cattle\n\nDeforestation\n\nPlants \"fix\" carbon (a phenomena called \"Carbon sequestration\"), the less plants, the less fixing (and the more carbon released by fires).\n\n\nsource\n\n\n  \n\n\n&mdash;Carbon sequestration: Forest and soil, by Jukka Muukkonen, Statistics Finland\n\nThe Oceans\n\nChanges to the biological equilibrium of the oceans affect the climate because marine biology is known to have a large carbon-fixating effect\n\n\nsource\n\n\n  One of the most promising places to sequester carbon is in the oceans, which currently take up a third of the carbon emitted by human activity, roughly two billion metric tons each year.\n\n\n&mdash;Carbon Sequestration in the Ocean\n\nConclusion\n\nAll four of these effect can be shown in a laboratory and no model is required to do so, but we have very very good models to explain the lab experiments.\n\nDifferently from the lab, the whole climate system is much less understood. And, yes, the model are not as reliable as we would like.\n\nHowever &mdash; due to our knowledge of chemistry &mdash; it is undeniable that we are affecting climate. Note that nobody has asserted that human intervention is the only cause of climate change, but it can be said, with a straight face, that humans are changing climate.\nA very simple example, the rise in temperature melts ice at the pole - which is not only responsible for reflecting some light out of the atmosphere, but also contains methane, which is then released.\n\nThe debate can only be on \"how much\" and \"how well can we reverse the trend (even beyond our contribution)\".\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/41#480", "answerId": "480"}

{"question": "Is it unsafe to swim during a lightning storm?", "questionId": "466", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/466", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "The theory, the way I've understood it, is that you're more likely to be the highest elevated point, when you're in the water, since there are rarely any surrounding tall objects, such as trees. This is more likely to be true for a boat than for a person swimming, obviously. This is the same warning as that with regards to standing near a tree during lightning. The reasoning is that you should get away from tall objects, and certainly not comprise one yourself, during lightning.\n\nThe rationale for this is that an electrical discharge always seeks out the shortest path to ground. Shortest path, here, refers in part to the physical distance between the lightning source and the target, but also to resistance - if there's something more conductive in the vicinity of the highest point, this might be the lightning target instead. There is no reason to expect this shouldn't hold true for lightning - indeed, it is by this premise a lightning rod works - but to the extent that it does, it does so rather crudely. Not infrequently does lightning strike very close to a lightning rod, without hitting it, despite the rod being the highest elevated point. When swimming, attracting lightning strikes to your direct vicinity can be just as fatal as attracting a strike immediately to yourself, which is my next point:\n\nSo much for the risk of being hit. Another concern with swimming during a lightning storm is the danger of any lightning strike, regardless of whether or not it hits you. On land, it's quite easy to see to it that you're relatively safe. Inside a car, for instance, you're protected since you're inside a conducting enclosure (see Gauss's Law). Non-distilled water is a good conductor, which means you could be in danger if lightning strikes in your vicinity, not only if it hits you. The best source I've found for that is some dude who's apparently a lightning researcher in Argonne, who says:\n\n\n  My guess is that the average lightning strike would electrify a few hundred feet worth of water from it's strike point sufficiently to electrocute someone.  Note that the Straight Dope suggests a radius of twenty feet or so.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/466#467", "answerId": "467"}

{"question": "Does the logarithmic nature of global warming invalidate climate change claims?", "questionId": "37709", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/37709", "category": "climate-change", "categoryId": 1, "answer": "The claim that \"... the effectiveness of CO2 as a greenhouse gas diminishes logarithmically with increasing concentration and from the current level of ~390 ppmv, ...\" and that \"inconvenient fact\" is \"well disguised for any lay reader\" is one of the more ridiculous climate skeptic claims I've seen.  The main metric used by climate scientists to describe the effect of carbon dioxide is called \"climate sensitivity\".  Equilibrium climate sensitivity is the amount of warming we expect to see resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2.  This directly tells you (provided you understand logarithms) that there is a logarithmic relationship between carbon dioxide concentrations.  If ECS is 2\u00b0C per doubling that means if we raise CO2 from the pre-industrial equilibrium concentration (i.e. up to 560ppm from 280ppm) then we would expect to see a 2\u00b0C temperature rise once the climate system had fully re-equilibriated.  However to get the next 2\u00b0C rise, you would need to double the atmospheric CO2 again (i.e. up to 1120 ppm) and to get a third 2\u00b0C increase you would need to double it again, up to 2240ppm.  \n\nNote that log2(280) = 8.1293, log2(560) = 9.1293, log2(1120) = 10.1293 and log2(2240) = 11.1293, so if we have y=c*log2(x), each time we double x, y increased by c, which is why expressing climate sensitivity in \u00b0C per doubling is just saying that the relationship is logarithmic in a way that ought to be clear even to someone who doesn't know what a logarithm is.  The constant c in this equation is ECS, if you use a log to a different base (e.g. ln or log10) then the numeric value of c will be different, but the relationship is the same, it is just easier to explain in terms of log2.  This is hardly rocket science!\n\nClearly, there is a \"diminishing returns\" effect here, but (i) far from hiding it, the climatologists are explicitly pointing it out in a form more easily understood even than logarithms (ii) to get a 2\u00b0C rise, you would only need to double CO2 levels from the pre-industrial level of 280ppm, and we have raised it to 400ppm already, so this is far from impossible, given that estimates of ECS are around 1.5-4.5\u00b0C per doubling. \n\n\n  \"there is high confidence that ECS is extremely unlikely less than\n  1\u00b0C and medium confidence that the ECS is likely between 1.5\u00b0C and\n  4.5\u00b0C and very unlikely greater than 6\u00b0C.\" IPCC AR5 WG1, page 924\n\n\nDo a google scholar search for \"climate sensitivity\", or look for it in the index of the IPCC reports and read the relevent sections, far from being hushed up, climatologists talk about this a lot.  \n\nNow of course the greenhouse effect is self-limiting, for a start for that not to be the case we would require the Sun's luminosity to be infinite (as CO2 affects the Earth's radiative balance, but ultimately the energy comes from the sun), or equivalently to allow an infinite timescale (which isn't possible either).  The Stefan-Boltzman law that says the power radiated per unit area rises with the fourth power of temperature is also a strongly limiting factor (but that doesn't rule out temperatures being very high due to the greenhouse effect, e.g. Venus, so that isn't much consolation ;o).\n\nIn short, a logarithmic relationship does not rule out a 2\u00b0C rise in global mean surface temperatures, double atmospheric CO2 concentrations a sufficient number of times and it will happen (once the radiative balance is restored, which doesn't happen immediately).  How many doublings this requires depends on the equilibrium climate sensitivity, and according to current scientific understanding (as articulated by the IPCC AR5 WG1 report) the answer is most likely one doubling (as the most probable value is a little over 2\u00b0C per doubling), but it could be less but it is very unlikely that the number is two or more doublings (as ECS below 1\u00b0C has been essentially ruled out).\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/37709#37730", "answerId": "37730"}

{"question": "Do side sleeping postures contribute to breast sagging?", "questionId": "9621", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9621", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "I am going to convert my comments to an answer, since this seems to be a bit of a tough nut to crack.\n\nFirst of all, the CNN article links to an article on Health.com which states the same thing.  The only reference is that a Dr. Roshini Rajapaksa makes this assertion.  There is no links or discussion of any studies or even any particular expertise in this.  Dr. Roshini Rajapaksa is actually a Gastroenterologist, and as such may not be fully qualified to speak on the subject of breast tissue, or breast sagging.  At her NYU web page, it shows that she has no studies listed to her credit.  She does have numerous articles and publications in the field of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology.  From 1999 to 2008 (on her web page), all the publications are in her area of expertise.  Later on though, in 2008, she started publishing in the Health Magazine, and the articles seem to step outside the bounds of her expertise.\n\nAs to the claim of breast sagging, I got led around to quite a few sites on the internet, and can't seem to find a great deal of impartial information on the subject.  I examined first of all if there is actually a ligament involved in the physiology.  On that count, there is.  It is called the Cooper's ligament.  This wikipedia article says:\n\n\n  Many women have held the mistaken belief that sagging is caused by the failure of the Cooper's ligaments to support the breast tissue. In fact, sagging is partly determined by genetic factors, but cigarette smoking, a woman's body mass index, her number of pregnancies, the size of her breasts before pregnancy, and age are all influencing factors.\n\n\nThe citation wikipedia gives is somewhat questionable in my opinion, because it seems to suffer from the same problem that the assertion that your sleep position can cause sagging....  That is, it doesn't cite any original research on the subject.\n\nThe medical term for sagging breasts is called Ptosis of the breast (as opposed to plain Ptosis that generally refers to eyelid drooping).  Again, I am not able to locate any specific studies on breast ptosis and sleeping position.  All the studies indicate that it's simply the combined effect of gravity, combined with time.  With time being the main contributor, because ligaments just naturally wear out over time.\n\n\n  Aging: Because of the way that breasts are built, sagging is common and largely unavoidable. After all, breasts contain no muscles of their own to hold them up. Rather, breasts are made of fat, glands, milk ducts, and a type of connective tissue called the \"Cooper's ligaments,\" which are thought to provide some structural support. As a woman gets older, these ligaments may get stretched and lose elasticity. Breasts may lose fullness and size as they lose their underlying support system of tissue and fat. \n\n\nAn advice column at Columbia University does say that:\n\n\n  Contrary to popular belief, going braless doesn't mean that your breasts are destined to droop. There's also nothing unhealthy about wearing one as long as it fits properly. Bras do not preserve the shape or perkiness of breasts. Sagging results from a number of factors unrelated to brassiere wearing, such as:\n  \n  \n  breast fat and tissue composition\n  softening of breast ligaments and loss of breast tissue with age\n  enlarged breasts during pregnancy, which causes the skin to stretch and remain stretched even after they revert to pre-pregnancy size\n  effects of gravity over a woman's lifetime\n  \n\n\nAgain, the main factor appears to be age and time, and not sleeping position.\n\nIn all these cases, there is a mention of gravity.  Physiologically, all the previously cited places indicate that if a woman has large breast, they will naturally sag more just because they are large.  However, the Cooper's ligament still is able to accommodate that weight as part of its job.  The only thing that affects the ligament tissue, from what I read in the papers, was the loss of elasticity due to natural aging.  They will not cause accelerated sagging due to sleeping position (or not wearing a bra).\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9621#9656", "answerId": "9656"}
{"question": "Are women who have had children less likely to get breast cancer?", "questionId": "5421", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5421", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "According to the American Cancer Society, yes.\n\n\n  Not having children or having them later in life: Women who have had\n  not had children, or who had their first child after age 30, have a\n  slightly higher risk of breast cancer. Being pregnant many times and\n  at an early age reduces breast cancer risk. Being pregnant lowers a\n  woman's total number of lifetime menstrual cycles, which may be the\n  reason for this effect.\n\n\nIn addition, not having breast fed also appears to be a cause:\n\n\n  Not breast-feeding: Some studies have shown that breast-feeding\n  slightly lowers breast cancer risk, especially if the breast-feeding\n  lasts 11\u20442 to 2 years. This could be because breast-feeding lowers a\n  woman's total number of menstrual periods, as does pregnancy. But this\n  has been a hard area to study. In countries such as the United States,\n  breast-feeding for this long is uncommon.\n\n\nThey could be linked; I'm not sure if the studies could find women who had never breast fed but also had children.\n\nEDIT According to this study in 1983, the first birth is protective, but later first birth has a potential for higher risk.   A further study done in Danes found that if the first childbirth is done between the ages of 20 and 29, then that's the best for risk reduction:\n\n\n  After adjusting for age and stage of disease (tumour size, axillary\n  nodal status and histological grading), the number of full-term\n  pregnancies was found without prognostic value. However, women with\n  primary childbirth between 20 and 29 years experienced a significantly\n  reduced risk of death compared with women with primary childbirth\n  below the age of 20 years [20-24 years: relative risk (RR) = 0.88, 95%\n  confidence interval (CI) 0.78-0.99; 25-29 years: RR = 0.80, 95% CI\n  0.70-0.91].\n\n\nPresumably, the study did not contain any statistically significant sample of women older than 29 for their first childbirth to make relevant statistical comparisons.\n\nEDIT 2 In response to @Hendy's comment, here's some further research, done in 1986:\n\n\n  Nulliparous women with a family history of breast cancer had a\n  relative risk of 2.7 (95% Cl = 1.4\u20135.2). Women with a family history\n  who first gave birth by age 20, between ages 21 and 29, and after age\n  30 years had relative risks of 0.53, 2.1, and 4.0, respectively (95%\n  Cl = 0.08\u20133.8, 1.1\u20133.9, and 1.8\u20139.6, respectively).\n\n\nThese risks are relative to the 1.0 risk from a study done in Connecticut.  Note the direct contradiction with the study Danish study; this later study was performed at Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, and found that risk was less in younger women, while the opposite was apparently true in Denmark.  The difference in timing (the latter study done in 1986, the former in 2006) may also indicate that changes in breast cancer treatments are affecting population dynamics, but that's pure conjecture.\n\nThe causal risks to check for are carcinogens (such as increased estrogen that can be linked to obesity) followed by family history, or, in other words, genetic predisposition to the disease.  Mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2 genes and other genetic markers (TP53, PTEN, STK11/LKB1, CDH1, CHEK2, ATM, MLH1, and MSH2, ibid; BRCA1 and 2 are the most 'famous') are known causal genetic links to having the disease.  The effect of childbirth or lactation appears to be difficult to make anything other than a correlative rather than causal link.\n\nAnecdotally, the doctors I worked with all suggested that lactation was the real protection, because without it, the breasts have no real biological function.  Lactation made sure they got some use, the thinking went, and so the cells were put to work and weren't sitting idle, making cancer instead of milk.  They may have been just yanking my chain, though.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5421#5422", "answerId": "5422"}

Despite these\n  reports, not a single air crash has\n  been proven to be caused by the use of\n  a cell phone onboard a plane.\n  \n  John Nance, an ABC News consultant and\n  veteran airline pilot, says there's\n  little reason to worry about cell\n  phones interfering with an airplane's\n  navigational equipment.

Finally,   evaluators   implicitly gravitated  toward  and  explicitly  fought  for candidates with whom they felt an emotional spark of commonality. \n\n\nD'Aveni looks at academia and find finds that:\n\n\n  There is evidence of homosocial reproduction. Senior faculty tend to hire junior faculty trained at schools ranked favorably by the same constituency as the schools where they themselves were trained, thereby reinforcing the strengths and reputations of their schools.\n\n\nThe effect is known as similarity attracts and is not only applicable to recruitment, but to many other areas of business. For example Westphal and Zajac find that CEO's tend to favor directors similar to themselves and that CEO's salaries are likely to be higher, if the board and CEO are demographically similar.\n\n\n  We propose that powerful CEOs seek to appoint new board members who are demographically similar, and therefore more sympathetic, to them. Using a longitudinal research design and data on 413 Fortune/Forbes 500 companies from 1986 to 1991, we examine whether increased demographic similarity affects board decision making with respect to CEO compensation contracts. The results show that (1) when incumbent CEOs are more powerful than their boards of directors, new directors are likely to be demographically similar to the firm's CEO; (2) when boards are more powerful than their CEOs, new directors resemble the existing board; and (3) greater demographic similarity between the CEO and the board is likely to result in more generous CEO compensation contracts\n\n\nIf you want to find more studies, you can start by searching for \"recruitment similarity\" on google scholar.

{"question": "Do hand sanitizers have a negative impact on the human immune system?", "questionId": "7209", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7209", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "While it is nearly impossible to carry out an experiment on whether hand sanitiser usage will cause the immune system to misfire/fail, there have indeed been peer-reviewed experiments carried out on the fact that significant reduction in exposure to infections/antigens (a likely result of overuse of hand sanitisers) may result in a hampered immune system, which may lead to autoimmune diseases. This is known as the hygiene hypothesis. \n\nEpidemiological data suggests that immigrants to relatively \"clean\" countries, such as Australia and the UK suffer from additional risk of autoimmune diseases. It has been suggested that living in a \"clean\" country increases the risk of developing autoimmune diseases, presumably due to the reduced exposure to microbes.\n\n\n  Among adolescents who were migrants to Australia, the prevalence of asthma symptoms was higher than that reported using a similar methodology in their country of origin. Asthma symptom prevalence was related to residence time in Australia. \n\n\nOf course, correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, research has been done to associate the hygiene hypothesis on the molecular and cell biology levels. \n\nOn the molecular/cell biology viewpoint, it has also been shown that reduced exposure to bacterial endotoxins (a product of bacteria) was correlated an increase in hay fever and other autoimmune diseases. \n\n\n  Endotoxin levels in samples of dust from the child's mattress were inversely related to the occurrence of hay fever, atopic asthma, and atopic sensitization. Nonatopic wheeze was not significantly associated with the endotoxin level. \n\n\nThe introduction of lipoproteins found in bacterial cell walls into mice was also shown to reduce inflammation caused by allergic asthma in mice. \n\n\n  Mucosal administration\n  of OprI at the time of allergen challenge suppressed eosinophilic\n  inflammation in the airways, and this suppression was sustained\n  after a second allergen challenge\n\n\nThere has also been some contradictory evidence on the hygiene hypothesis. \n\n\n  Serologic evidence of exposure to certain gastrointestinal pathogens (eg, hepatitis A virus) has been inversely associated with either allergen sensitization or asthma in some, but not all, recent studies. Although heavy infestation with certain parasites (eg, helminths) is protective against allergen sensitization, there is conflicting evidence regarding the relation between parasitic infection and asthma. \n\n\nIn conclusion, the hygiene hypothesis is certainly not a fully accepted scientific theory, but further research will likely shed more light on this. \n\n\n  Studies are elucidating that susceptibility involves genetic variants and environmental exposures, alteration of our microbiome and potentially large-scale manipulation of the environment over the past century. Many of the findings reviewed are preliminary and will need confirmation, but exciting new paradigms and hypotheses are emerging as a result of these preliminary findings.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7209#25138", "answerId": "25138"}

The effect of\n  unknown confounders may well be\n  operating in either direction within\n  and across all of the included\n  studies. \n  \n  The studies from high-risk\n  groups included in this review do\n  report a powerful protective effect of\n  circumcision, measured by both\n  unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios.\n  More mixed results were reported for\n  the general population. As all the\n  observed results could be explained by\n  likely confounding, RCTs are essential\n  before circumcision is implemented as\n  a public health intervention.\n  Implementation of circumcision will\n  encounter cost, both financial and in\n  terms of potential personal harm; no\n  adverse effects are reported in this\n  review only because none of the\n  observational studies investigated\n  them.

Victoria's son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany suffered from the disease. For this reason, haemophilia was once popularly called \"the royal disease\". Tests of the remains of the Romanov imperial family show that the specific form of haemophilia passed down by Queen Victoria was probably the relatively rare Haemophilia B.[1]\n  \n  The sex-linked X chromosome disorder manifests almost entirely in males, although the gene for the disorder is located on the X chromosome and may be inherited from either mother or father. Expression of the disorder is much more common in males than in females. This is because, although the trait is recessive, males only inherit one X chromosome, from their mothers. Thus if the haemophilia gene is transmitted on it, there is no possibility for the male to inherit a haemophilia-free gene from his father to mask or dilute the symptoms. By contrast, a female who inherits a gene for haemophilia on one of her X chromosomes will also have inherited a second X chromosome from the other parent which is likely to carry a haemophilia-free gene that would prevent full expression of symptoms.\n  \n  Females who inherit the gene for Haemophilia A or B from both parents would be expected to manifest full symptoms, similar to those seen in affected males, but this is extremely rare. Despite frequent inter-marriage among royalty, no case of such double inheritance is known among Queen Victoria's descendants.\n\n\nSo:\n\n\nQueen Victoria had it\nBreeding passed it into other royal families\nYes, it was because of \"inbreeding\" that it was passed to several royal families -- if other royal families had intermarried more with commoners there would have been less chance for Queen Victoria's genes to affect every other royal family\nIt expressed in males but, no there was not enough \"inbreeding\" (i.e. two affected X chromose) for it to ever express in females\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/23648#23649", "answerId": "23649"}

The response time for the climate system to reach\n  equilibrium is also uncertain. This depends primarily on the amount of energy transported\n  through the near-surface ocean mixed layer to the deep ocean.\n  \n  An increase in TSI [total solar irradiance] of 1 [watt per sq. m.] produces solar forcing [Delta]Fsol = 0.7\u00d71/4 = 0.18 [watt per sq. m.],\n  where the scale factors account for the Earth\u2019s albedo and the geometric illumination of the\n  entire Earth surface by the Sun. Assuming a climate sensitivity to solar forcing of 0.6 \u00b0C per\n  [watt per sq. m.]  (i.e. midway in the estimated range), an increase in TSI of about 1 [watt per sq. m.] from the seventeenth century Maunder Minimum to the present solar-cycle average produces global\n  warming of 0.1 \u00b0C. This estimated warming is reduced by about 20 % to 0.08 \u00b0C in the\n  NRLTSI2 model and is not reduced at all in the SATIRE model when using the new sunspot\n  record to reconstruct TSI. The difference is small and within the uncertainty of the TSI reconstructions\n  themselves (Figures 5 and 6). Furthermore, this possible solar-caused global\n  surface-temperature increase is significantly lower than the net measured temperature increase\n  of at least 0.8 \u00b0C over the same four-century time frame.\n\n\n....\n\n\n  The net effect on climate according to this new sunspot-number record is at a nearly\n  insignificant level. Using the SILSO record, global-warming estimates that are attributable\n  to solar variability over the last four centuries may be up to 20%lower than current estimates\n  suggest, perhaps causing only a 0.08 \u00b0C increase instead of a possible 0.1 \u00b0C increase in\n  global surface temperature. These differences are negligible compared to the uncertainties,\n  and either contribution to overall global warming remains much lower than those that are\n  due to other climate influences.\n\n\nSo half of 0.6 \u00b0C being due to change in the Sun's output is ruled out. \n\nOn the other hand, even more recently, there is Solar activity has a direct impact on Earth's cloud cover and the corresponding journal article The response of clouds and aerosols to cosmic ray decreases Journal of Geophysical Research Volume 121, September 2016, Pages 8152\u20138181 \n\nwhich, quoting from the popular article, says:\n\n\n  \"Earth is under constant bombardment by particles from space called galactic cosmic rays. Violent eruptions at the Sun's surface can blow these cosmic rays away from Earth for about a week. Our study has shown that when the cosmic rays are reduced in this way there is a corresponding reduction in Earth's cloud cover. Since clouds are an important factor in controlling the temperature on Earth our results may have implications for climate change\", explains lead author on the study Jacob Svensmark of DTU\n\n\nSo overall the direct effect of total solar irradiance on the climate over the past 110 years has been shown to be small, but indirect effects, such as  regulation of cloud formation by controlling incoming cosmic rays, have not been ruled out.  \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/35963#35988", "answerId": "35988"}

So while I am not able to answer the question directly, I'll hope to make clear why the presented argument is on shaky grounds and hence one does not need to accept Austin's conclusion because of that.\n\nLet's begin with Robin Austin defining what cancer is:\n\n\n  I have two answers. One is it may be due to a fundamental, general instability in any\n  system which has mutations going on where you\u2019re reproducing yourself.\n  There\u2019s a fundamental danger there. It\u2019s the risk that the system is\n  willing to accept in order to evolve.\n\n\nA system is not willing to \"accept\" anything in order to do anything, let alone \"to evolve\". There is no need for livings being to evolve, no goal to be achieved. All we know is that they do, hence the variations of life.\n\nIt's true that due to the imperfect replicating process errors can lead to sicknesses, yet a necessity for such a system to be prone to cancer does not follow. There are multiple different genetic defects, why should cancer be special and intrinsic to the process?\n\nAustin continues:\n\n\n  It may also be plan B in the sense that we\u2019re supposed to age and die.\n  It\u2019s very important that we die. If you take good care of yourself so\n  the normal ways of death don\u2019t happen, the system will go ahead and\n  turn something else on to make sure that individual ceases.\n\n\nWe are not supposed to do anything. Living beings simply are. We humans tend to search for meaning where there is none to be found and this seems to be one example of that. \n\nIt's neither important nor unimportant that we die. Importance is quite a strange concept to apply here.\n\nLiving beings are until they die. If they procreate before death, then their offsprings simply are, too. And what stays around, stays around. No need to die, unless you assume that evolution must happen, and that there never could occur a constant state, like a planet only being inhabited by one big immortal plant covering its entire surface.\n\nThere is no evolutionary pressure that forces livings beings to gain immortality, but that doesn't mean the individual must die within a certain time frame. (In fact, Turritopsos Nutricula might as well have evolved into something that can be deemed de-facto immortal.)\n\nSo to say that cancer is our body's mean to ensure that we die because we must die does not follow. It sounds like an ad-hoc rationalization to make sense out of a (meaningless) sickness.\n\nIt's like saying we were supposed to die of bacteria. And by that logic, the invention of antibiotics would have been a bad thing.\n\nFurthermore, we eliminated a lot of other threats which would have killed us in the past, so there isn't much left to kill us. One remaining candidate happens to be cancer. And car accidents. And smoking. Would anybody claim that driving a car and smoking would be \"the system's\" means to ensure that we die someday?\n\n\n  TS: So, cancer is a way of killing off individuals to support survival\n  of the species, like programmed cell death kills off certain cells\n  within the body to support survival of the organism?\n  \n  RA: Yeah, it\u2019s apoptosis on a large scale. That\u2019s why the immune\n  system gives it a pass. In fact, the body might even fight your\n  attempts to reverse the process, because it actually wants it to\n  happen.\n\n\nEvolution does not work on the species scale. Quite frankly, the individuals of the same species are their own worst enemies as they primarily compete against each other for living space, food, and mating partners. Think about a lion killing the cubs of a lonesome lioness. If evolution would favor the species, how would that have evolved? If we only look on the individual case instead, there would be no paradox.\n\nSo the individual is the agent in evolution (or more precise, as Dawkins famously argued, the selfish gene. Yet genes do not occur lonesome on this planet anymore).\n\nNatural selection determines if the individual is fit enough to procreate in a given environment. Each living being has to procreate for their genes to \"live on\" or where that is not possible, (e.g. a working bee), ensure its closest relatives to live on.\n\n\n  TS: Are you saying that cancer is ultimately good for us?\n  RA: Yeah, on a species level. We all know that to evolve, we must have mutations. Cancer is more prevalent in humans, because that is the mechanism driving our rapid evolution.\n\n\nTo say cancer is good for us on a species level is as valid as to say \"the wolf that caught a slower deer is helping the deers as a species\". By that logic, the caught deer must be thankful for being caught and eaten.\n\nYet the wolf has no intent of helping the deers as a species. It needs food to survive and does so by hunting. It happens that while hunting the wolf most likely will only catch slow and sick animals, while the others more often will escape.\n\nSame with the cancer. It most likely \"wants\" nothing. It simply occurs due to \"defective\" genetics. Would anyone shout at the diagnosis of cancer: \"Oh joy, I have cancer. My body wants to kill me to enhance the human species. How nice of my body!\" I do not think so.\n\nThe damning thing about cancer is that there is no evolutionary pressure against it, as we develop its fatal symptoms mostly in our adulthood and it kills its host in relative old age long after it most likely has reproduced. (Or to say it differently: We humans did not evolve a resistance against cancer for the same reasons dinosaurs did not evolve resistance against big comets hitting the earth.)\n\nSo, is cancer a trade-off to allow for faster mutations? I do not know. Yet it is just as well conceivable that cancer occurs because of harmful mutations without any benefit from it.\n\n(That isn't to say that there aren't some mutations that hinder old age, yet can be deemed beneficial in the sense that they allow humans to live long enough to procreate in the first place, like sickle cell anemia that lowers the risk of Malaria.)\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/15725#15746", "answerId": "15746"}

Numerous studies have been made between hair colour and various other traits, and they all pretty much come up with poor correlations in terms of actual personality.  The abstract on this paper states (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  A collection of studies beginning with one that looked at correlations with descriptive terms chosen by young males for blondes, brunettes and red heads and by the females themselves for Eysenck's EPQ-R personality measures. The descriptives were chosen in an absolutely stereotypical way. There was an apparent association between extraversion and blondeness, lie scale (social conformity) with dark hair and psychoticism (social non-conformity) with having red hair. The follow-up looked at stereotypes of women about women, which largely confirmed those of the men in the earlier study. The next study looked at how much or if at all dying hair to a different colour changes personality. Using the EPQ-R again, only those women who dyed blonde showed a significant change in personality; however, with reference to the first study they did not become extravert or more extravert but became significantly more psychotic (socially non-conformist). Theirs was a banner of rebellion! \n\n\nIn reading this paper, and a few others, it generally appears more the EXPECTATION of how one behaves that drives the actual behaviour based on the hair colour.\n\nAmongst males in the UK (CEO level), it was again concluded that people's perceptions had a greater corollary than actual personality (PDF).\n\nNumerous \"twin studies\" do give credence to the \"nature\" hypothesis of how people tend to develop, however, there seems to be very little actual study on if there are actual correlations between the personality of the person and their hair colour.\n\nKeep in mind, most of these studies are Euro-centric.  For instance, in Chinese culture, red is considered a bright and happy colour.  So anyone in china that is fortunate to have red hair (very rare mind you), is considered a fortunate and happy person.\n\nAs with external traits, and personality, there is no single catch all.  We still do not understand how genetics play into developing a person's overall behaviour.  What switches are involved that, for instance makes a person aggressive, temperamental, etc. and how they are tied to other genes.

{"question": "Is D-Wave Systems's \"D-Wave One\" a quantum computer?", "questionId": "16112", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/16112", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "Yes in the sense that it uses quantum properties to perform computations, but no in the more general case since it is not a Turing machine (i.e. universal computer). \n\nThis answer is somewhat complicated by the fact that what the general public thinks of as a computer and what computer scientists formally define as a Turing machine. Turing machines are interesting from a mathematical standpoint since any computer algorithm can be run on a Turning machine and Turing machines can simulate one another which gives rise to the concept of Turing completeness. \n\nThe quantum equivalent to a conventional Turing machine (i.e. a desktop computer) requires the use of quantum circuits that allow for general algorithms to be run on it. In keeping with Turing completeness, conventional computers can actually simulate quantum computers that make use of quantum circuits.\n\nSo with that in mind we can now turn to the D-Wave device for closer examination. D-Wave Systems own documentation for developers tells us the following:\n\n\n  The processor in the D-Wave One \u2013 codenamed Rainier \u2013 is designed to\n  perform a single mathematical operation called discrete optimization.\n\n\nAlong with,\n\n\n  Rainier solves optimization problems using quantum annealing (QA),\n  which is a class of problem solving approaches that use quantum\n  effects to help get better solutions, faster.\n\n\nRight off the bat we know that the D-Wave is not going to be Turing complete since it can only perform a single mathematical operations which means that it is not a quantum computer in the general sense; however, what about the specific case?\n\nWhen first introduced there was quite a bit of controversy that D-Wave was not taking advantage of quantum effects to actually solve problems. However, this partly resolved with their 2011 publication of \"Quantum annealing with manufactured spins\" in Nature which contains the following point of interest in the abstract,\n\n\n  Here we use quantum annealing to find the ground state of an\n  artificial Ising spin system comprising an array of eight\n  superconducting flux quantum bits with programmable spin\u2013spin\n  couplings. We observe a clear signature of quantum annealing,\n  distinguishable from classical thermal annealing through the\n  temperature dependence of the time at which the system dynamics\n  freezes. Our implementation can be configured in situ to realize a\n  wide variety of different spin networks, each of which can be\n  monitored as it moves towards a low-energy configuration\n\n\nThe paper is quite interesting but the mathematics can be quite heavy at times as well though. The key point of the paper is summarized in the conclusion,\n\n\n  This brings us to our main conclusion: a programmable artificial spin\n  system manufactured as an integrated circuit can be used to implement\n  a quantum algorithm. The experiments presented here constitute a step\n  between understanding single-qubit annealing and understanding the\n  multi-qubit processes that could be used to find low-energy\n  configurations in a realistic adiabatic quantum processor. In addition\n  to its problem-solving potential, a system such as this also provides\n  an interesting test bed for investigating the physics of interacting\n  quantum spins, and is an important step in an ongoing investigation\n  into much more complex spin systems realized using this type of\n  architecture. Although our manufactured spin system is not yet a\n  universal quantum computer, by adding a new type of coupler between\n  the qubits, universal quantum computation would become possible.\n\n\nIn short, the paper explains the implementation of a means of doing adiabatic quantum computation. This paper was part of what ultimately lead some of D-Waves critics to back off their previous positions and look more favorably on the company. This in turn has lead to a general warming of the scientific communities options towards the company. \n\nThis position that the D-Wave is in fact using quantum effects was further reinforced by the University of Southern California who in 2013 released an article validating the use of quantum effects in the processor,\n\n\n  \u201cOur work seems to show that, from a purely physical point of view,\n  quantum effects play a functional role in information processing in\n  the D-Wave processor,\u201d said Sergio Boixo, first author of the research\n  paper, who conducted the research while he was a computer scientist at\n  ISI and research assistant professor at USC Viterbi\n\n\nA 2013 pre-print article up titled \"Quantum annealing with more than one hundred qubits\" also raises a very interesting point, \n\n\n  Considering the pure annealing time, the performance for typical\n  (median) instances matches that of a highly optimised classical\n  annealing code on a high-end Intel CPU.\n\n\nMeaning that as of right now, there might not be much advantage in using their device over a conventional computer. However, they go on to note that, \n\n\n  Quantum speedup can then be detected by comparing the scaling results\n  of the simulated classical and quantum annealers to experiments, as we\n  discuss in detail in the supplementary material. Going to even larger\n  problem sizes we soon approach the limits of classical computers.\n  Optimistically extrapolating using the observed scaling, the median\n  time to find the best solution for our test problem will increase\n  from milliseconds to minutes for 2048 variables, and months for 4096\n  variables, and the scaling might be much worse if fat tailed\n  distributions start to dominate, as we had previously observed for\n  other Monte Carlo algorithms [28, 29]. A quantum annealer showing\n  better scaling than classical algorithms for these problem sizes would\n  be an exciting breakthrough, validating the potential of quantum\n  information processing to outperform its classical counterpart.\n\n\nMeaning that they still feel that for larger data sets their device is likely to be a superior performer over a standard computer for these types of problems.\n\nSo to summarize, in the general sense of the D-Wave One being a Turing machine, it is not which means that it is not a quantum computer in the strictest sense of the meaning. However, in the more general sense that the D-Wave One is using quantum effects to perform calculations, the answer appears to be yes.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/16112#16146", "answerId": "16146"}

Please ignore any voting on it.\n\n\n\n\nI won't perform any calculation here as they are not on topic on Skeptics, but the confusion seems to arise from the fact that in combustion a fuel (in this case, gasoline) and an oxidant (in this case, oxygen in the air) combine to produce other compounds, among which is carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\n\n  Combustion or burning is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as smoke. \n\n\nSo as you can see, we have two substances combining.  Applying the principle of conservation of mass, the output needs to have the same mass as the input, which is more than only the fuel.\n\n\n  The conservation of mass was obscure for millennia because of the buoyancy effect of the Earth's atmosphere on the weight of gases. For example, a piece of wood weighs less after burning; this seemed to suggest that some of its mass disappears, or is transformed or lost. This was not disproved until careful experiments were performed in which chemical reactions such as rusting were allowed to take place in sealed glass ampoules; it was found that the chemical reaction did not change the weight of the sealed container and its contents.\n\n\nOf course, this only shows that the total mass of the combustion products can be (and usually is, except for some special cases like solid rocket fuels that contain their own oxidizer) greater than the mass of the fuel alone.\n\nShowing that this is also true for just the CO2 (not counting any other combustion products, such as water vapor or soot) produced when gasoline is burned in a car engine would require either direct experimental measurement or non-trivial calculations based on the chemical composition of gasoline and knowledge of the temperatures and air and fuel ratios found in typical modern internal combustion engines.\nSuch calculations would be off-topic for this site, so I will not provide them; if desired, they may be found in textbooks on chemistry or automotive engineering.\n\nStill, even without determining exactly how much CO2 burning a gallon of gasoline will produce, we can at least see that it can be more than the mass of the fuel, since some of the mass will come from oxygen in the air.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40499#40528", "answerId": "40528"}

This is mostly true, although intolerances and allergies to Apples are reasonably common.  However, there's no particular evidence that this aids recovery.  Patients should eat a diet that is gentle on the system and that they are happy with.  The most important treatment from diarrhea is rehydrative treatment.  Treatment in the main does not focus on relieving symptoms, instead focussing on preventing harm from dehydration, which is the biggest hazard.\n\nThe actuality is that BRAT provides a far from balanced diet, and is more of a tradition than a scientifically grounded diet.  Although the Carbohydrate content is adequate, as are some other nutrients like Potassium, it lacks in many areas, including fibre - and the basis of it was that a low fibre diet would help avoid further upsets.

This paper just demonstrates that other effects are important too, and that bikes can be stable without gyroscopic forces or trail. \n\n\n  Why can a bicycle balance itself? One necessary condition for bicycle self stability is (once we define the words carefully) that such a bicycle turns into a fall. \n\n\nThis situation seems similar to that of aircraft, where the Bernoulli effect is often cited as being the cause of lift, while planes can fly without it (for example when they fly upside down, which some planes can do.)

According to the study, your average modern joint is going to have between 60mg and 150mg of THC (which mirrors information gathered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), with upwards of 300mg of THC if there's hashish oil involved.\n\nFrom the study: THC 2.5mg in a cigarette is enough to produce measurable psychological and physical effects in occasional cannabis users.\n\nHowever (emphasis mine): Approximately 50% of the THC and other cannabinoids present in a cannabis cigarette enter the mainstream smoke and are inhaled. The amount absorbed through the lungs depends on the smoking style. In experienced smokers, who inhale deeply and hold the smoke in the lungs for some seconds before exhaling, virtually all of the cannabinoids present in the mainstream smoke enter the bloodstream.\n\nSo if it's an inexperienced toker and they're taking quick, short puffs, then it's plausible that you could (assuming you were inhaling significant amounts of the exhaled smoke) get a contact high that only slightly lags behind the person smoking.\n\nAt the same time, if you're in the same room as an experienced user who holds the breath in for a couple of seconds, it might take you a while.

These studies are commonly confused.\n\nThe 6 (22) countries study was one he authored himself and presented in 1953 at a symposium at Mt. Sinai Hospital, New York City.  Some of the work came from field work done in Europe 1951-1952 when he was a Senior Fullbright Fellow headquartered at Magdalen College, Oxford, and other data came from research grants from the National Heart Institute, and the National Dairy Council, Chicago.\n\nIn the paper he describes his methods and he discusses the validity of death certification. He excludes \n\n\n  Western Germany, and Finland because of major population shifts and\n  other effects from the war, and Iceland, Luxembourg and some colonies,\n  and semi-independent states with very small populations.\n\n\nIn the paper, he clearly states that  \n\n\n  So far it has been possible to get fully comparable dietary and vital\n  statistics data from 6 countries.\n\n\nNow if you look at his graph together with Uffe Ravnskov's right hand graph where the claim of cherry picking is made.  Ravnskov includes data for all 22 countries for mortality data and consumption of total fat ( not saturated fat as is stated in the question ) which was collected by Yurushalamy &amp; Hilleboe ( using different sources from Keys ).\n\n\n\nYou now have a chance to see the data for the countries he dropped.  Mexico's (14) data was notoriously unreliable, and appears to go against the trend.  But note that Finland (7) is also dropped where the relationship appears to be even stronger (the numbering seems wrong for the countries).  So, this is very odd cherry picking that removes data that both supports and weakens the hypothesis.  And it is clear that the relationship still is present even if you include the data which was considered by Keys to be unreliable or not comparable, or where the diets were not considered different enough to include.\n\nThe 7 countries study was a totally different beast.  This was a multicenter prospective long term study which started in 1957:\n\n\n  Beginning in 1957 Keys and his colleagues began what would eventually\n  be known as the Seven Countries Study by surveying 12 000 men aged 40\n  to 59 from 18 areas of seven countries (Italy, the Greek Islands,\n  Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, Finland, Japan, and the United States).\n  Study communities were chosen for their contrasting dietary patterns\n  and the relative uniformity of their rural laboring populations.\n  Through central chemical analysis of the foods consumed by randomly\n  selected families as well as diet-recall measures, Keys and his\n  colleagues were able to determine that in societies where fat was a\n  major component of every meal (i.e., the US and Finland), both the\n  blood cholesterol levels and the heart-attack death rates were\n  highest. Conversely, in cultures where diets were based on fresh fruit\n  and vegetables, bread, pasta, and plenty of olive oil (i.e., the\n  Mediterranean region) blood cholesterol was low and heart attacks were\n  rare. The report published in 1970 had a decisive impact on CVD\n  prevention, as it described one of the first studies to clearly show\n  that dietary saturated fat leads to CVD, and that the relationship is\n  mediated by serum cholesterol. [3]\n\n\nRegarding Taubes' purported claim, that Keys picked the 7 countries for the 7 countries study knowing that their data would support his suspicions, then this is already addressed in his paper.  The entry criteria included:\n\n\n  Study communities were chosen for their contrasting dietary patterns\n  and the relative uniformity of their rural laboring populations.\n\n\nIt would be logical to assume that further entry criteria were that they shared similar diagnostic criteria, and the countries were stable enough to support such a long term study.  \n\nIt is absurd for Taubes to write that Keys 7 countries study was invalid as he was somehow able to predict the results 29 years in advance, and that each population would show the same relationship of diet with heart disease both between countries and also inside each study population.

And the body uses every source of fuel to fulfil this necessity. This includes carbohydrates. They are used for this and they are even the preferred source of energy for that. Ketosis  states are only achieved if supply of carbohydrates are too low to meet these requirements.\n\n\n\nThis looks quite like a simple reversal of language that just needs interpretation:\n\nFor a large part this seems almost adequate, albeit in oversimplified form of imprecise terms. If you watch the video, it becomes clear that she talks about: \n\n\n  Basal metabolic rate\n  Metabolism comprises the processes that the body needs to function.2 Basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy per unit time that a person needs to keep the body functioning at rest. Some of those processes are breathing, blood circulation, controlling body temperature, cell growth, brain and nerve function, and contraction of muscles. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) affects the rate that a person burns calories and ultimately whether that individual maintains, gains, or loses weight. The basal metabolic rate accounts for about 60 to 75% of the daily calorie expenditure by individuals.\n\n\nNothing in the body needs sugar \u2014 from the diet and strictly speaking \u2014 or any other carbohydrate;    \n\n\n  Although one current recommended dietary carbohydrate intake for adults is 150 g/d, it is interesting to examine how this recommendation was determined at a recent international conference (5):\n  \n  \u201cThe theoretical minimal level of carbohydrate (CHO) intake is zero, but CHO is a universal fuel for all cells, the cheapest source of dietary energy, and also the source of plant fiber. In addition, the complete absence of dietary CHO entails the breakdown of fat to supply energy [glycerol as a gluconeogenic substrate, and ketone bodies as an alternative fuel for the central nervous system (CNS)], resulting in symptomatic ketosis. Data in childhood are unavailable, but ketosis in adults can be prevented by a daily CHO intake of about 50 g. \n  \n  Eric C Westman: \"Is dietary carbohydrate essential for human nutrition?\" The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Volume 75, Issue 5, May 2002, Pages 951\u2013953, DOI  \n\n\nexcept the brain:\n\n\n  The mammalian brain depends upon glucose as its main source of energy, and tight regulation of glucose metabolism is critical for brain physiology. Consistent with its critical role for physiological brain function, disruption of normal glucose metabolism as well as its interdependence with cell death pathways forms the pathophysiological basis for many brain disorders. \n  \n  Sugar for the brain: the role of glucose in physiological and pathological brain function\n\n\nAll other organs, liver, muscles etc., might get their energy needs from fat or even protein. How good of an idea that is would be another question.\n\nBut as the brain needs carbs and accounts for quite a bit of metabolic rate, this specific organ should not be discounted... \n\n\n  We find that the brain\u2019s metabolic requirements peak in childhood, when it uses glucose at a rate equivalent to 66% of the body\u2019s resting metabolism and 43% of the body\u2019s daily energy requirement, and that brain glucose demand relates inversely to body growth from infancy to puberty. Our findings support the hypothesis that the unusually high costs of human brain development require a compensatory slowing of childhood body growth.\n  \n  Christopher W. Kuzawa et al.: \"Metabolic costs and evolutionary implications of human brain development\", Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Sep 9; 111(36): 13010\u201313015, 2014 Aug 25. DOI\n\n\nIf there is no carbohydrate coming from food, the liver will and has to produce ketones which can sustain brain function or engage in gluconeogenesis.\n\nBut immediately before the questioned claim we see:\n\n\n  The body needs those basal metabolic calories in the form of fat, protein, vitamins, and minerals. And that's all it needs for those.\n\n\nVitamins and Minerals provide zero calories.\nWhat the author seems to mean is that \"food contains calories\" and that from that food she regards only the fat, protein, vitamins and minerals as essential nutrients; or 'needed for basic metabolism'?\nWithin the framework of a special weight reduction diet, that would then make some sense, albeit the terminology and its usage remain confusing.\n\nWith this level of linguistic imprecision in scientific terminology, it seems hard to answer \"is this correct\" with anything else but: \"No\".\n\n\n  Thus, cells that use glucose as their primary energy source are less susceptible to stress and harmful conditions than cells that use other energy sources or that exhibit higher rates of glycolysis. Although our knowledge about the critical role of glucose metabolism in the maintenance of high level brain function has grown considerably in recent years, the various factors that regulate glucose uptake and utilization in the CNS are not well understood. Moreover, the brain must regulate the relative use of glucose, glutamine, and ketone bodies for energy under normal circumstances and especially during development and aging.\n  \n  The brain is the metabolically most active organ and is therefore highly dependent on a continuous supply of its fuel. To meet its very high energy demands, the brain (around 1/40 of the body weight) possesses a relatively high blood flow and glucose consumption equal in amount to about one-fifth of the entire resting requirements of the body. In mammals, the regulation of fuel metabolism is regulated principally to serve the needs of brain and muscle, the major consumers of fuel. The adult mammalian brain relies almost completely on glucose as energy source while ketone bodies (KB) are preferentially directed toward lipid synthesis (Roeder et al., 1982; Yeh, 1984). The KB consist of acetoacetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. In nonruminant mammals, the liver is the only significant site of KB formation through fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Cultured astrocytes, however, may produce KB at rates similar to those of hepatocytes and like hepatocytes appear to be ketogenic cells (Blazquez et al., 1998; Guzman and Blazquez, 2001). After entering the blood, KB are oxidized in extrahepatic tissues, under particular circumstances also the brain, by mitochondrial enzymes to form acetyl-CoA, the substrate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Glycolysis not only meets the brain\u2019s constant need for fuel but also provides the substrate for anabolic processes, namely pyruvate which via the TCA cycle and anaplerotic pathways is the source for a variety of amino acids and neurotransmitters such as GABA and glutamate, and for acetyl-CoA which is used for lipid and acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis.\n  \n  Donard Dwyer (Ed): \"Glucose Metabolism in the Brain\", International Review Of Neurobiology Volume 51, Academic Press: Amsterdam, Boston, 2002.\n\n\nSimple glucose is often described as the preferred fuel for all cells. That most of them can also use an alternative energy source doesn't make the carbohydrates \"useless for basal metabolic rate\".\nThe claim seems more like a simplified demonisation of a nutrient a human body usually puts to good use to stay alive; and sometimes even to use a brain for thinking.\nThe video with the claim seems to advertise a low-carb diet and sells it by using a description for a weight-reduction and -control diet that seems to be confusing metabolic pathways of 'calories' from minimal amounts of dual-use essential macronutrients (proteins) with calories from 'pure fuel' macronutrients (carbs).\n\nWhat the claimant apparently wants to express with 'basal metabolic rate' is that the first fraction of ingested proteins are usually used for tissue maintenance and build-up, like muscles; and can be used as energy as well. Whereas carbohydrates are mainly used for immediate energy or storage in glycogen and fat.\n\nAs the author of the claim is now a somewhat controversial figure, some circumstantial evidence might help to evaluate her statements:\n\n\n  Correction to Harcombe Z, Baker JS, Cooper SM, et al.

{"question": "Does skimmed milk have more added chemicals than whole milk?", "questionId": "7571", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7571", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "The prescriptionist scientist in me rejects the question as meaningless! The descriptivist in me compels me to try to answer the question you meant to ask.\n\n\n\nBoth whole milk and skim milk (in the USA) may be fortified with vitamins A and/or D. \n\nSharon Gerdes wrote in Dairy Foods (Feb 2009):\n\n\n  The dairy industry has been adding vitamin D3 to milk since 1932. In the 1940s, the dairy industry also began fortifying with vitamin A.\n\n\nThey can also be fortified with other nutrients such as Calcium.\n\nHowever, the milk must be labeled if they are fortified. There are limits to what can be added to milk and still call it \"milk\". (See Section 131.110 of Standards of Identity.)\n\nThe fortification is optional, so it depends on the source. So, to see what additives are in your preferred brands of milk, check the labels. Before you discard the ones with more Vitamin A and D, ask if you are really concerned that the risks of extra vitamins outweigh the benefits - ditto with the fat content.\n\nHowever,  Cornell University's Milk Facts suggests a motivation for additional Vitamin A fortification in skim milk: because it is naturally lower in vitamin A, it needs more added to bring it to the same levels as whole milk.\n\n\n  Whole milk is considered a good source of vitamin A. Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in the fat phase of milk. The vitamin A content that occurs naturally in 2%, 1% and skim milk is less than in whole milk because of the lower fat levels. Nutritional concerns about consumption of lower fat milk in the late 1970s led to the required fortification of vitamin A in lower fat milks. To achieve the nutritional equivalence of whole milk, lower fat milks should be fortified to 300 IU vitamin A per 8 oz serving. The FDA encourages fortification to a level of 500 IU of vitamin A per 8 oz serving, which is 10 % of the recommended daily allowance (RDA).\n\n\n\n\nLetting my inner prescriptionist off his leash for a moment:\n\nIn science, the word \"chemical\" means the same as chemical substance.\n\n(Ref: High school chemistry, plus the above Wikipedia article that states: 'the term chemical substance is a precise technical term that is synonymous with \"chemical\" for professional chemists'.)\n\nUnder this definition, everything is either a chemical substance or a mixture of chemical substances. (Okay, not everything. Not light or heat or love or skepticism, but everything made of solids, liquids, gasses or plasma. Everything you can touch, taste or smell.)\n\nSo, 1kg of whole milk is 100% chemicals, and 1kg of skim-milk is 100% chemicals. No difference.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7571#7572", "answerId": "7572"}

It is scientifically dishonest for somebody to cherry-pick that 1992 study and not mention the research that has been done since then.\n\n(Klebanoff et al. 1993) noted that \"two recent studies have found that infants who received intramuscular vitamin K were at twice the expected risk for cancer during childhood.\" They referenced (Golding et al. 1990) and (Golding et al. 1992). All the work since then refers back to Golding et al. as having suggested the association between vitamin K and leukemia. My guess is that it is Golding et al. that was mentioned in the Midwifery Digest as they estimated the incidence between 1.87 and 2.04 per 1000 (matching approximately the 1 per 500 in the claim). (Klebanoff et al. 1993) performed an independent study to examine this hypothesis.\n\nThey found \"no increased risk of either cancer in general or leukemia in particular among children who received vitamin K during the perinatal period; this finding is in accordance with the observation that the incidence of childhood leukemia in the United States did not increase from 1948 (when few or no newborns received vitamin K) to 1980 (when nearly every newborn received the drug).\"\n\n(Vitamin K Ad Hoc Task Force 2003) also addressed the evidence behind this hypothesis. They summarized:\n\n\n  The Vitamin K Ad Hoc Task Force of the American Academy of Pediatrics reviewed the reports of Golding et al and other information regarding the US experience and concluded that there was no association between the intramuscular administration of vitamin K and childhood leukemia or other cancers.\n  \n  Additional studies that have since been conducted by other investigators have not supported a clinical relationship between newborn parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer.\n\n\nThey mention specifically (Ross and Davis 2000) that \"found no randomized or quasi-randomized evidence of an association between parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis and cancer in childhood. Ten case-control studies were identified, of which 7 found no relationship and 3 found only a weak relationship of neonatal administration of intramuscular or intravenous vitamin K with the risk of solid childhood tumors or leukemia.\"\n\nThe Vitamin K Ad Hoc Task Force also notes that \"recent research on the pathogenesis of childhood leukemia additionally weakens the plausibility of a causal relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and cancer.\"\n\nLast, the Cochrane Review of (Puckett and Offringa 2000) stated that \"taken as a whole, these studies do not establish a causal relationship between these routes of administration and an increased risk of cancer\", and that \"no randomized or quasi randomized evidence with regard to the association between parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis and cancer in childhood was found.\"\n\nWhy might the original studies have found an association?\n\nMaybe there was a correlation in the Golding et al. sample that doesn't exist in the full population. There is always a small risk of a false positive. However, a few things stand out to me that might have increased the risk of a false positive in those initial studies.\n\nThe original studies (and even many of the subsequent studies) were case-control studies. One draw-back of this type of study \"relates to the difficulty of obtaining reliable information about an individual\u2019s exposure status\". This was evident in the studies of Golding et al. They admit that \"one of the problems encountered in abstracting data from the notes was the fact that the route of vitamin K administration was often not recorded, although vitamin K was noted as having been given.\" They employed \"several strategies [...] to identify the probable route of administration\". These were not blinded.\n\nContrast that with the study of Klebanoff et al., which, while also a (nested) case-control study, used data from a previous prospective cohort study, that had exact records of a child's vitamin K administration (route, dose, name, for example). The later cancer diagnoses were blinded as to the vitamin K exposure status.\n\nAdditionally, Golding et al. tested for multiple correlations (at least two: pethidine, and Vitamin K), and reported significance without correcting for multiple hypothesis tests. Test for enough correlations, and you'll find one by chance.\n\nReferences\n\nGolding, J., M. Paterson, and L. J.

{"question": "Do nice guys finish last?", "questionId": "3477", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3477", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Yes for short term, probably not for long term.\n\nI think you somewhat answered this already, at least for short term mating/relationships (per Jonason). There does seem to be evidence that the \"dark triad\" personality provides an advantage when it comes to short term mating, but perhaps not for long term relationships.\n\n\n\n\nJonason, et al. The Dark Triad: Facilitating a Short-Term Mating Strategy in Men, European Journal of Personality, 2009 (LINK).\n\n\n\n  We found that the scores on the Dark Triad traits were positively related to having more sex partners, an unrestricted sociosexuality and a greater preference for short-term mates. We demonstrated that the association between the Dark Triad composite was correlated with short-term mating above and beyond effects of participant\u2019s age, sex and extraversion.\n\n\nHowever, from the same report, we have this:\n\n\n  Whereas such a strategy capitalises on quantity at the cost of receiving long-term benefits, individuals who are not high on the Dark Triad traits\u2014the majority of populations\u2014may be better equipped to form cooperative long-term relationships and, to a lesser degree, short-term relationships without deception. This long-term, nonexploitive strategy may represent a slower but more stable approach to reproduction.\n\n\n\n\n\nJonason, et al., The costs and benefits of the Dark Triad: Implications for mate poaching and mate retention tactics, Personality and Individual Differences, 2010 (LINK).\n\n\nThis study finds that high scorers on the dark triad scale are more likely to \"poach\" those already in a relationship and/or to be poached by others in a relationship:\n\n\n  ...scores on the Dark Triad were correlated with rates of poaching mates from others for new relationships and being poached by others for new relationships. Such associations may explain the higher numbers of sexual partners by high scorers on Dark Triad traits (Jonason et al., 2009). That is, by being willing to poach others away from their relationships and by being willing to leave ongoing relationships for new ones, such opportunistic individuals enjoy access to more novel romantic or sexual partners.\n\n\nFor this to work... there's at least some indication that dark rriad traits are enough to promote infidelity in a previously existing relationship... but we don't know if \"nice guys\" are the ones having their mates poached. In fact, the same study goes on to say:\n\n\n  Dark Triad individuals tend to have their own mates poached away by others.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlia &amp; Chamorro-Premuzic, The dark side of love and life satisfaction: Associations with intimate relationships, psychopathy and Machiavellianism, Personality and Individual Differences, 2010 (LINK).\n\n\nThis study finds that Machiavellianism (one of the dark triad traits) is negatively correlated with relationship intimacy (which I take to imply a lower long-term relationship satisfaction):\n\n\n  Machiavellianism was negatively associated with life satisfaction and intimacy, which is not surprising when considering that this trait is associated with negative emotions (e.g., McHoskey et al., 1998) and a lack of interpersonal affect in interpersonal relationships\n\n\n\n\n\nJonason &amp; Kavanagh, The dark side of love: Love styles and the Dark Triad, Personality and Individual Differences, 2010 (LINK.\n\n\nThis last study may suggest, again, that dark triad high-scorers are more apt to choose short term mating strategies vs. long term endeavors.\n\n\n  These individuals may go into relationships of any kind because of their own needs; the other individual may be immaterial or irrelevant. That is, the features of the other person are not the determining factors that lead to relationships emerging for those who are high on the Dark Triad. Instead, these individuals may \u201cuse\u201d others to get what they want. We do not contend that these individuals are ambivalent to the attractiveness of their partners, but instead, their short-term mating lifestyle may be expressed in a \u201cwhatever I can get\u201d attitude. However, this question does deserve future attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilbur &amp; Cambell, What do women want? An interactionist account of women\u2019s mate preferences, Personality and Individual Differences, 2010 (LINK)\n\n\nLastly, this article suggests that women want primarily attractiveness for short-term mates, and both attractiveness and ambition (signaling genetic fitness and a good provider) for dating and long-term relationships:\n\n\n  ...attractive targets were preferred as short-term sexual partners...ambitious men were preferred as dating partners [and] attractive men were preferred as dating partners...ambitious men were preferred as long-term romantic partners [and] attractive men were preferred as long-term romantic partners...\n\n\n\n\n\nGangestad et al.,  Women's Preferences for Male Behavioral Displays Change Across the Menstrual Cycle, Psychological Science, 2004 (LINK).\n\n\nThis might be the money study/quote right here:\n\n\n  A sample of 237 normally ovulating women viewed 36 or 40 videotaped men who were competing for a potential lunch date and then rated each man's attractiveness as a short-term and a long-term mate. As predicted, women's preference for men who displayed social presence and direct intrasexual competitiveness increased on high-fertility days relative to low-fertility days, but only in a short-term, not a long-term, mating context.\n\n\nOne would need the whole report to know what \"social presence\" and \"intrasexual competitiveness\" implies -- I'm reading this as dominating/confidence and attractiveness. Now quite the \"dark triad\" but perhaps related. At the very least we find that desires for \"alpha\" signals wane as relationship desires shift from short to long.\n\n\n\nSummary: So, from your own sources and some I've provided, I'd put the results like so:\n\n\nWomen do prefer \"bad boys\" for short-term mating choices, despite the intuitively negative desirability of such choices\nHigh \"dark triad\" scorers self report more sex partners than non-high-scorers (so they're obviously finding willing participants)\nHigh \"dark triad\" scorers self-identify as preferring short term mating scenarios\nAt least one of the dark triad components, Machiavellianism, seems to diminish relationship intimacy (which I think decreases long term relationship predicted success, but I could be wrong)\nWomen seem to prefer attractiveness and ambition, period\nWomen's desires changed based on both fertility and whether or not they are seeking short or long-term relationships (short-term seeking and fertility increases desirability of \"alpha male\" signals)\n\n\nSo, for long term strategies, it doesn't seem that dark triad high-scorers will fare as well. Across the board, attraction and ambition (or money) influence relationship partner choices a lot, and fertility and the type of mate (long vs. short term) will also affect what about a male is attractive.\n\nHope that doesn't cloud the water too much -- none of these provided quite what I hoped, but I think they are related enough to list as an answer.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3477#5230", "answerId": "5230"}

In the present paper, seven questions are posed, examined, and addressed:\n  \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse were the gay/lesbian households in the published literature behind the APA Brief?\n  \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How many studies of gay/lesbian parents had no heterosexual comparison group?\n  \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;(3) When there were comparison groups, which groups were compared?\n  \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Does a scientifically-viable study exist to contradict the APA\u2019s published\n  statement that \"not a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents\n  to be disadvantaged\"?\n  \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;(5) What types of outcomes have been investigated?\n  \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;(6) What do we know about the long-term outcomes of children of lesbian and\n  gay parents?\n  \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Have the studies in this area committed the type II error and prematurely\n  concluded that heterosexual couples and gay and lesbian couples produce similar parental outcomes?\n\n\nThe 2005 APA Brief in question states that\n\n\n  Not a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents.\n\n\nIn short, the paper points out multiple significant flaws in the research referenced by that brief. The paper does not question the validity of the research done, but it does show how we should be highly skeptical of the claim made by the APA until further research has been done.\n\n\n\nRegarding what the paper found for each of the seven questions:\n\n\n  In summary response to Question 1 (\"How culturally, ethnically, and\n  economically diverse were the gay/lesbian households in the published literature behind the APA Brief?\"), the reader may ascertain that none of the cited articles (pp. 23\u201345) focus on African-American, Latino, or Asian-American families. Further, many studies do not include any minority individuals or families. Finally, comparison studies on children of gay fathers were almost non-existent as well. By their own reports, social researchers examining same-sex parenting have repeatedly selected non-representative, homogeneous samples of privileged lesbian mothers to represent all same-sex parents. This pattern across three decades of research raises significant questions regarding lack of diversity and lack of generalizability in the same-sex parenting studies.\n\n\n\n\nHow many studies of gay/lesbian parents had no heterosexual comparison group? (This is actually the response for question two)\n\n\n  Of the 59 publications cited by the APA in the annotated bibliography section entitled \u2015Empirical Studies Specifically Related to Lesbian and Gay Parents and Their Children\u2016 (pp. 23\u201345), 33 involved a heterosexual comparison group. In direct response to Question 2, 26 (44.1 percent) of the studies on same-sex parenting did not include a heterosexual control group. In well-conducted science, it is important to have a clear comparison group before drawing conclusions regarding differences or the lack thereof. We see that nearly half of the \u2015Empirical Studies Specifically Related to Lesbian and Gay Parents and Their Children\u2016 referenced in the APA Brief allowed no basis for\n  comparison between these two groups (see Table A). To proceed with precision, this fact does not negate the APA claim. It does, however, dilute it considerably as we are left with not 59, but 33, studies with heterosexual comparison groups.\n\n\n\n\nWhen there were comparison groups, which groups were compared?\n\n\n  Because children in marriage-based intact families have historically fared better than children in cohabiting, divorced, step, or single-parent families on the above outcomes, the question of what \"groups\" researchers selected to represent heterosexual parents in the same-sex parenting studies becomes critical.\n  \n  ...\n  \n  In total, in at least 13 of the 33 comparison studies listed in the APA Brief\u2019s list of \"Empirical Studies\" (pp. 23\u201345) that include heterosexual comparison groups, the researchers explicitly sampled \"single parents\" as representatives for heterosexual parents. The repeated (and perhaps even modal) selection of single-parent families as a comparison heterosexual-parent group is noteworthy, given that a nonpartisan Child Trends (2002) review has stated that \"children in single-parent families are more likely to have problems than are children who live in intact families headed by two biological parents.\"\n  \n  ...\n  \n  As we return to the APA\u2019s section of 33 published \"Empirical Studies\" (pp. 23\u2013 45) that directly involve heterosexual comparison groups, we see that the repeated, and perhaps modal, practice of same-sex parenting researchers has been to use single parents as heterosexual representatives. Nebulously defined \"mothers\" and \"couples\" are frequently used as heterosexual comparison groups, but only in rare cases are explicitly intact, marriage-based families used as the group representing heterosexual parents. This is important because the intact, marriage-based family is the family form consistently associated with best children\u2019s outcomes in large-scale research.\n\n\nIn other words, it appears much of the research has found children raised by homosexual parents to be comparable in outcomes to children raised in conditions known to be sub-optimal.\n\n\n\n\n  Question 4 asked: Does a scientifically viable study exist to contradict the APA\u2019s published statement that \"not a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged\"? The answer is yes. Sarantakos (1996) controlled for \"education, occupation, and socio-economic status\" and then, based on teacher reports, compared marriage-based families with homosexual families and found nine significant differences\u2014with children from marriage-based families rating higher in eight areas. By objective standards, compared with the studies cited by the APA Brief, the Sarantakos study was:\n  \n  a) The largest study to examine children\u2019s outcomes,\n  \n  b) One of the most comparative (only about five other studies used three\n  comparison groups), and\n  \n  c) Perhaps the most comprehensively triangulated study (five data sources)\n  conducted on same-sex parenting.\n  \n  Accordingly, this study deserves the attention of scientists interested in the question of homosexual and heterosexual parenting, rather than the dismissal it received from APA. As we conclude the examination of Question 4, let us review a portion of APA\u2019s\n  published negation of Sarantakos\u2019 study:\n\n[Children Australia, the journal where the article was published] cannot be\nconsidered a source upon which one should rely for understanding the state of\nscientific knowledge in this field, particularly when the results contradict\nthose that have been repeatedly replicated in studies published in better\nknown scientific journals.\n\n  \n  Patterson and the APA dismissed the Sarantakos study, in part, because it contradicted the \"no significant difference\" findings that had been \"repeatedly replicated in studies published in better known scientific journals.\" For other scientists, however, the salient point behind Sarantakos\u2019 findings is that the novel comparison group of marriage-based families introduced significant differences in children\u2019s outcomes (as opposed to the recurring \"no difference\" finding with single-mother and \"couple\" samples). Additional studies with intact, marriage-based families as the heterosexual comparison group are conspicuously rare in the APA Brief\u2019s list of \"Empirical Studies Specifically Related to Lesbian and Gay Parents and Their Children\" (pp. 23\u201345).\n\n\n\n\n\n  In response to the present article\u2019s Question 5 (what types of outcomes have been investigated for children of gay/lesbian families?), it may be concluded: In the same-sex parenting research that undergirded the 2005 APA Brief, it appears that gender-related outcomes were the dominant research concern, to the neglect of other important outcomes. To be more precise, Table A lists several categories of information regarding 59 published empirical studies; one of these categories is the \"outcome studied.\" More than 20 studies have examined gender-related outcomes, but there was a dearth of peer-reviewed journal articles from which to form science-based conclusions in myriad areas of societal concern including: intergenerational poverty, criminality, college education and/or labor force contribution, drug/alcohol abuse, suicide, sexual activity and early childbearing, and eventual divorce as adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Did any peer-reviewed, same-sex parenting study cited by the 2005 APA Brief (pp. 23\u201345) track the societally significant long-term outcomes into adulthood? No.\n  \n  Is it possible that \"the major impact\" of same-sex parenting might \"not occur during childhood or adolescence...[and that it will rise] in adulthood as serious romantic relationships move center stage\"? Is it possible that \"when it comes time to choose a life mate and build a new family\" that the effects of same-sex parenting will similarly \"crescendo\" as they did in Wallerstein\u2019s study? It is possible.\n  \n  From a scientific perspective, the unfortunate answer to the question regarding the long-term (i.e., adult) outcomes of lesbian and gay parenting is that we have no empirical basis for responding, because not a single peer-reviewed comparison study has followed same-sex parented children across time and into mid-adulthood.\n\n\n\n\nHave the studies in this area committed the Type II error?\n\n\n  Same-sex parenting studies have not employed large enough samples to overcome the possibility, or probability, of the Type II error, thereby \"substantially increasing [the] likelihood\" of failing to find differences. Further, significant critiques provided by social research methodology specialists Lerner and Nagai (2001) were not cited in the 2005 APA Brief. If the conclusion to be drawn is that there are no parenting differences between same-sex and heterosexual couples, such a conclusion cannot be drawn at the present time, given this problem with the Type II error, pervasive in the same-sex parenting literature.\n  The APA Publication Manual urges researchers to \"take seriously the statistical power considerations\" and \"routinely provide evidence\" of adequate statistical power and effect sizes, however, a review of the 59 articles cited in the APA Brief (pp. 23-45), revealed that only a few complied. Further examination indicated that of the comparison studies, zero studies reached the \"minimum requirement\" of 393 to detect a small effect size. Indeed, only two comparison studies reached half of the minimum requirement.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, here's their overall conclusion:\n\n\n  We now return to the overarching question of this paper: Are we witnessing the emergence of a new family form that (unlike cohabiting, divorced, or single-parent families) provides a context for children that is equivalent to the intact family? Even after an extensive reading of the same-sex parenting literature, the author cannot offer a high confidence, data-based \"yes\" or \"no\" response to this question. The data are insufficient to support a strong claim either way, and thus insufficient to produce a definitive binary statement. Such a statement would not be grounded in science. Representative, large- sample studies are needed\u2014many of them, including high quality longitudinal studies (i.e., Table B). Although some same-sex opponents have made \"egregious overstatements\" and, conversely, some same-sex parenting researchers seem to have implicitly contended for an \"exceptionally clear\" verdict of \"no difference\" between same-sex and heterosexual parents since 1992, a closer examination leads to the conclusion that strong assertions, including those made by the APA, were not empirically warranted.\n  \n  The scientific conclusions in this domain will be clearer as researchers: (a) move from small convenience samples to larger nationally representative samples, (b) increasingly examine critical societal and economic concerns that emerge during adolescence and adulthood, (c) include more diverse same-sex families (e.g., gay fathers, racial minorities, and those without middle-high socioeconomic status), (d) include intact, marriage-based heterosexual families as comparison groups, and (e) acknowledge and respond to experts\u2019 methodological critiques in the effort to refine and add validity and rigor to findings. In connection with this latter point, it is particularly vital that statistical power no longer be ignored. Taking these steps will help lead the field towards more nuanced and scientifically informed responses to significant questions affecting families and children.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nHere are two studies that show negative effects. They attempt to use more random samples in order to avoid self-selection bias. Neither can conclusively say what is causing the negative effects - from the former:\n\n\n  Although the findings reported herein may be explicable in part by a variety of forces uniquely problematic for child development in lesbian and gay families\u2014including a lack of social support for parents, stress exposure resulting from persistent stigma, and modest or absent legal security for their parental and romantic relationship statuses\u2014the empirical claim that no notable differences exist must go. While it is certainly accurate to affirm that sexual orientation or parental sexual behavior need have nothing to do with the ability to be a good, effective parent, the data evaluated herein using population-based estimates drawn from a large, nationally-representative sample of young Americans suggest that it may affect the reality of family experiences among a significant number.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2153#23422", "answerId": "23422"}

It had a ring of material that had been thrown off the star some 20,000 years ago. When the star exploded the light from the explosion illuminated this ring 8 months later. Simple measurements of the size of the ring and the known distance to SN1987A yield a speed of light that is the same as the one we see today.\n\nPulsars also present serious problems to c-decay theories, because we see light and radio waves from pulsars as they spin. If the speed of light has changed then this should show up as changes in the time of arrival of the pulsar emissions today. \n\nEdit: As Gordon Davidsson (below) points out, SN1987A is not a good test here. Suppose that when SN1987A exploded the speed of light was faster than now. Whatever that speed was, the light from the ring would still be 0.6 LY behind the light from the supernova. Then both sets of light slow down to the current speed, and hey presto, we see the ring illuminated 0.6 years after the supernova explosion. \n\nHowever by the same token pulsars are a good test. Suppose a pulsar is spinning once a second. Each pulse of light directed towards Earth is a second behind of the last one. If the speed of light is much faster than now then the distance between the pulses will be much greater. Then if light slows down the pulses will still be the same distance apart, but because the light is travelling slower an observer on Earth will see the interval between the pulses increase. Since the pulses we are seeing today must have been in flight during this supposed slow-down of light, we would see pulsars seeming to slow down by significant amounts.

He knew that observed eye movement in REM state did sometimes correspond with reported subjective gaze direction in regular dreams. He'd also already mastered techniques to become lucid in a dream, but evidence of these was completely subjective. He then designed an experiment to get solid evidence of the phenomenon:\n\n\n  I thought that in a lucid dream I could look to the left and right, left and right, and thus make a unique and easily identifiable signal.\n\n\nThey could then monitor the dream in laboratory conditions, and gather data on lucid dreams. It worked. He says the signal-verified lucid dreams were almost without exception in phasic REM sleep mode.\n\nThe study was reportedly hard to get published, but was eventually published in Perceptual and Motor Skills. The following might be a reference to the study in question (found from the book's general references on lucid dreaming):\n\n\n  Gackenbach, J. and LaBerge, S., Conscious Mind, Sleeping Brain (New York: Plenum, 1986)\n\n\nUsing known techniques for gaining lucidity during dreaming, they succesfully performed different types of these signal-confirmed lucid dreaming experiments with other test subjects as well.

Any effect during a moving display will be very small (because the electrons in and LCD cannot drift as they can in a CRT), and will disappear once the display is steady again.\n\nThe other problem with CRTs is that they can become permanently magnetised, and thus always affect electrons as they fly to the screen. That is why CRTs sometimes need to be de-gaussed. In LCDs there is nothing to magnetise (and no flying electrons) so this effect is also negligible.\n\nAlso, I noticed that both your links point out that LCDs will not be affected by magnetic fields (actually the Win 7 link says that any effect is too minor to be visible).\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9432#9434", "answerId": "9434"}
{"question": "Can you put on more weight than what you eat?", "questionId": "2688", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2688", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "No. \n\nThis is because of something called ecological efficiency (or trophic level transfer efficiency). This is the efficiency with which energy or biomass is transferred from one trophic level to the one above it. This is virtually always less than 100%. \n\nThis is because biological organisms are not perfect converters (so the thermal efficiency is not 100%) and some energy is lost as heat, as well as the fact that not all energy can be used by the organism (it isn't in a form that can be digested completely or not fully bioavailable).\n\nAs a very rough average, only about 10% of the energy is kept as you go up to the next trophic level but this varies a bit depending on circumstances. This is e. g. why you need substantially more than 1 kg of grain to get 1 kg of beef.\n\nSo not only is it pretty much out of the question that you can gain more mass than you eat, it is also virtually impossible to gain as much as you eat, because some of that energy is lost as e. g. heat or used in basal metabolism.\n\nSure, you can invent fanciful situations with a high-tech, futuristic substance that has an enormous energy density and bioavailability while having a tiny mass, but for all practical intents and purposes, the answer is a resounding no.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/kling/energyflow/highertrophic/trophic2.html\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2688#34527", "answerId": "34527"}
{"question": "Does stress cause hair to go grey?", "questionId": "31896", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31896", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Evidence:\n\n\nA 2013 study found that hormones produced in response to stress can reduce melanocyte stem cells that determine hair color.\n\n\n\n  A 2013 New York University study published in Nature Magazine claimed a link between long-term ongoing stress and hair color. In that study, the researchers found that hormones produced in response to stress can deplete the melanocyte stem cells that determine hair color. They found that stress causes the stem cells to leave our hair follicles, leaving hair gray or white.\n\n\n\nThere are clinical observations for acceleration of hair graying for patients under stress.\n\n\n\n  Physicians have observed accelerated graying among patients under stress, says Tyler Cymet, head of family medicine at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, who conducted a small retrospective study on hair graying among patients at Sinai. \"We've seen that people who are stressed two to three years report that they turn gray sooner,\" he says. Cymet suspects that going gray is \"genetically outlined, but stress and lifestyle give you variation of plus or minus five to 10 years.\" \n\n\nMeaning:\n\n\nThere is no clear link established between stress and gray hair and also there is no proof for the theory that stress by itself causes gray hair.\n\n\n\n  In short, scientists are beginning to gather clues that stress can hasten the graying process, but there is no scientific evidence demonstrating a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\n\n\nHair turning gray involves many factors including genetic DNA.\n\n\n\n  Long story short, your hair (and probably the president\u2019s) will naturally start graying sometime in your 30s or 40s, depending on your DNA. And if you\u2019re perpetually stressed, the resulting inflammation can speed up your hair\u2019s chromatic transformation.\n\n\n\nReferring to dermatologist Dr. David Orentreich who is the associate director of the Orentreich Medical Group in New York and assistant clinical professor in the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, there is no research confirmation that hair suddenly turns white from fear or other stressor responses immediately or overnight. Also a proper research study of such shocking incidents is tough due to its unpredictability.\n\n\n\n  The puzzle of whether your hair can turn grey sounds like a simple one for medical science to solve, but it\u2019s not. Ultimately, to study exactly what happens you would need to examine the hair before and after a shocking incident, carefully assessing its colour and thickness. Life-threatening situations are not only rare, but unpredictable and no ethics committee is going to let you induce a sufficiently terrifying experience in a lab volunteer. \n\n\nHowever, there is a medical condition called alopecia ariata which causes the hair shed suddenly, resulting in bald patches.\n\n\n  The medical name for the sudden whitening of the hair is canities subita. The best explanation for it is not that the hair changes colour, but that the pigmented hairs fall out. A condition called alopecia ariata causes the hair shed suddenly, resulting in bald patches. It is thought to be caused by an auto-immune response, where the body\u2019s defence system turns on itself. It can be exacerbated by stress, which could account for the association of white hair with terrifying experiences. In some cases the white hairs are unaffected by the condition.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31896#31901", "answerId": "31901"}

It can be.\nMold is a known aeroallergen. Gastroesophageal reflux disease and eosinophilic esophagitis are closely linked:\n\nChris A. Liacouras &amp; Jonathan E. Markowitz: \"Eosinophilic Esophagitis\", Humana Press: New York, 2011, p253:\n\n\n  Allergen exposure has been well documented to have a role in the pathogenesis of pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). [...] In the adult population, it has been hypothesized that allergen exposure plays a role in the pathophysiology of adult EoE, supported by high rates of personal and family history of atopy. [...] there is increasing evidence for a role of food and aeroallergens [...] \n\n\nEpidemiology and Natural History of Eosinophilic Esophagitis:\n\n\n  Because EoE is an allergic condition, several environmental allergens have been implicated. First, food allergens trigger EoE and the disease can be put into remission by removal of specific foods, either via elimination diets or hypoallergenic elemental formulas.\n  \n  However, it is still not clear why foods that were tolerated over the course of human evolution would now induce EoE; the effects of farming practices, genetic modification, mass production, packaging, and other related factors have not been examined. \n  \n  Environmental or aeroallergens can also induce EoE \u2014 there are links between pollen season and EoE flares, seasonality of diagnosis of EoE (with more cases diagnosed during times of increase aeroallergens), and cold or arid climate zones. Odds of EoE are higher in rural areas with lower population\n  density, which might be explained by vegetation, pollution, or other environmental exposures.\n\n\nEsophagitis and its causes: Who is \"guilty\" when acid is found \"not guilty\"?\n\n\n  Esophagitis is mainly a consequence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, one of the most common diseases affecting the upper digestive tract. However the esophageal mucosa can also be targeted by some infectious, systemic or chemical conditions. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease, characterized by eosinophilic infiltration in the mucosa.Esophageal localization of Crohn's disease is not very common, but it should always be considered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease complaining of upper digestive tract symptoms. There are also forms of infectious esophagitis (e.g., Herpes simplex virus or Candida albicans) occurring in patients with a compromised immune system, either because of specific diseases or immunosuppressive therapies. Another kind of damage to esophageal mucosa is due to drug use (including oncologic chemotherapeutic regimens and radiotherapy) or caustic ingestion, usually of alkaline liquids, with colliquative necrosis and destruction of mucosa within a few seconds. Dysphagia is a predominant symptom in EoE, while infectious, drug-induced and caustic damages usually cause chest pain and odynophagia. Endoscopy can be useful for diagnosing esophagitis, although no specific pattern can be identified. In conclusion when a patient refers upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms and the diagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux disease is not convincing we should always carefully investigate the patient's clinical history to consider possibilities other than the gastric refluxate.\n\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis in patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms refractory to proton pump inhibitor:\n\n\n  The contribution of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) to refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains unknown. When EoE and GERD overlap, the clinical, endoscopic and histological findings are nonspecific and cannot be used to distinguish between the two disorders. Limited data are available on this topic, and the interaction between EoE and GERD is a matter of debate.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/38399#39799", "answerId": "39799"}

The full paragraph reads: \n\n\n  If the potassium-argon ages of a group of rocks agree with the stratigraphic sequence determined on the basis of physical relationships of fossil evidence, then the probability is good that radiometric ages are reliable. An example of this are the data in table 7-7. For single age measurements of units that either overlie or underlie beds containing fossils, the fossil evidence only places an upper or lower limit on the age determination. \n\n\nThe same section, titled \"Evaluation of age data\", also suggests duplicate measurements, preferably from different minerals.  \n\nAll data that scientists produce are, and should be, carefully examined for consistency. Dalrymple and Lanphere also suggest that several samples should be measured to be more able to identify problematic samples. If anything, this is good scientific practice, rather than taking a single measurement at face value. \n\nIn my own experience (I run an Argon geochronology lab), the approximate age of a sample is useful input to select the correct standards. The reason is analogous to trying to measure millimeters with a yardstick. If you calibrate your machine to measure very large amounts of Argon and you chose small sample size consequently, to have less gas load on the detectors, a young sample will then yield very large errors. It is possible and usually yields accurate, but less precise results (meaning larger error margins). The reasons for this are detailed in McDougall and Harrison: \"Geochronology and Thermochronology by the 40Ar/39Ar method\". We geochronologists strive to provide users with the best results possible. The exact age is irrelevant for the measurement, but it is useful to know it within an order of magnitude (millions of years, hundreds of millions of years or billions of years, for example).\n\nSee here for some examples where a geochronologist suggests that we should throw out more dates ! Simply because according to him, some labs have less stringent statistical requirements to accept an age. Although this particular paper addresses Ar/Ar dating, typically K/Ar method provides less tools to check for internal consistency and alteration, although in most cases K/Ar dates and Ar/Ar dates will yield similar results.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9701#26355", "answerId": "26355"}

Similar searches using Academic Search Premier at a well known research university also resulted in no results being returned. As such, it is reasonable to conclude that as of August 2013 no studies have been published that link Emacs and RSI.\n\nHowever, a number of neologisms exist for RSI such as \"BlackBerry thumb\", \"gamer's thumb\", and so forth. So if we consider \"Emacs pinky\" to be a neologism for any RSI that is encountered by Emacs users then the question changes to if heavy use of Emacs may lead to an RSI. As shown in the body of the question, it appears fairly well established that Emacs users refer to RSIs as \"Emacs pinky\" and this also supported by such sites as the EmacsWiki.\n\nLinks between typing and repetitive strain injuries is fairly well established and has been reported, \n\n\n  In a preliminary report issued earlier this year, NIOSH-Michigan\n  researchers found that 40% of more than 800 employees surveyed\n  reported symptoms of RSI, including pain experienced in hands, wrists,\n  elbows, shoulders or neck.\n  \n  The study was jointly requested and paid for by Newsday and the\n  Graphics Communication International Union Local 406, which represents\n  about half of Newsday's and New York Newsday's 3,100 full-time\n  employees. The study, the first comprehensive survey of RSI in the\n  newspaper industry, concluded that computer-terminal use at a\n  newspaper office presented \"a hazard\" to workers' health.\n\n\nAlthough it might not be linked to specific types of RSIs like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.\n\nFinally, we must also address the situation in which \"Emacs pinky\" is not a neologism, but a very specific type of injury. In that case we must again defer to the lack of studies that have been conducted to determine if Emacs is linked specifically to RSI in a users pinky. However, it is difficult to conclude if \"Emacs pinky\" is supposed to refer to a specific injury to the pinky since most anecdotes refer to general RSIs of the hands.\n\nA number of reports on the internet (one, two) that indicate that users of Emacs experience pain in their left pinky that they attribute to their use of Emacs due to the use of the Ctrl key for a number of commands. Assuming that these users are being honest in their reporting then these reports do provide us with a body of evidence that something is happening. In this case the hypothesis that the heavy use of the Ctrl by heavy users of Emacs causing pain in the left pinky is not unreasonable.\n\nSo to summarize, no studies have been conducted into Emacs use to determine if it causes a specific RSI that affects the pinky. It has been established that typing can cause RSI in which case the claim is valid if \"Emacs pinky\" is a neologism for RSI in general. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/17492#17493", "answerId": "17493"}

The military intentionally slices off the bottom third of test takers, not allowing them to join.\n\n\nThis information tells us that Peterson's claim is approximately correct. We know that there is a minimum equivalent IQ that is needed to get into the military.

Foer claims not to be a savant, but just a well-practiced mnemonist.

In contrast, fluctuation in dietary composition during the active period (as occurs in human beings) markedly influences whole body metabolic homeostasis. Mice fed a high-fat meal at the beginning of the active period retain metabolic flexibility in response to dietary challenges later in the active period (as revealed by indirect calorimetry). Conversely, consumption of high-fat meal at the end of the active phase leads to increased weight gain, adiposity, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperleptinemia (that is cardiometabolic syndrome) in mice.

{"question": "Do opposite types in romantic relationships attract?", "questionId": "3099", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3099", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "The answer to your question is, for the most part, no:  Opposites do not attract.\nLike-minded people attract; that is, the relationships they form are fuller and longer-lasting\nthan when paired with an opposite-minded partner.  This is despite the fact that people often claim,\nin surveys and when asked directly by interviewers, that they would like someone with personality\ncharacteristics different from their own; revealed preference and lived experience show that they\nreally don't know what they want.\n\nThe article, Do People Know What They Want: A Similar or Complementary\nPartner?, by a certain Pieternel Dijkstra,\nreviews the hypotheses, and the research, better than I could give myself:\n\n\n  With regard to [] \u201crelative\u201d mate preferences two hypotheses have been presented. First, according\n  to the \u201csimilarity-attraction hypothesis\u201d individuals feel most attracted to potential partners who,\n  in important domains, are similar to themselves (e.g., Lucas, Wendorf, and Imamoglu, 2004). Similar\n  individuals are assumed to be  attractive because they validate our beliefs about the world and\n  ourselves and reduce the  risk of conflicts (e.g., Morry and Gaines, 2005). Not surprisingly\n  therefore, similarity between partners contributes to relationship satisfaction (e.g., Lutz-Zois,\n  Bradley, Mihalik, and Moorman-Eavers, 2006). Because a happy and long-lasting intimate relationship\n  contributes to both psychological and physical health (e.g., Berkman and Syme, 1994), similarity\n  between partners increases their own and their offspring\u2019s chances of survival by helping maintain\n  (the quality of) the pair bond.\n  \n  In contrast, according to the \u201ccomplementarity hypothesis\u201d individuals feel most attracted to\n  potential partners who complement them, an  assumption that reflects the saying that \u201copposites\n  attract\u201d (e.g., Antill, 1983). Complementary individuals are assumed to be so attractive because\n  they enhance the likelihood that one\u2019s needs will be gratified (e.g., De Raad and Doddema-Winsemius,\n  1992). For example, young women who lack economic resources may feel attracted to older men  who\n  have acquired economic resources and therefore may be good providers (Eagly and Wood, 1999). In\n  addition, from an evolutionary perspective, one might argue that seeking a complementary mate,\n  rather than a similar one, may help prevent inbreeding.\n\n\nUltimately, this is the punchline (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  Studies on mate selection have consistently found support  for the \u201csimilarity attraction\u201d\n  hypothesis. Homogamy has been reported for numerous characteristics such as physical attractiveness\n  (e.g., White, 1980), attachment style (e.g., Klohnen and Luo, 2003), political and religious\n  attitudes (e.g., Luo and Klohnen, 2005), socio-economic background, level of education and IQ (e.g.,\n  Bouchard and McGue, 1981). In contrast, support for the \u201ccomplementarity hypothesis\u201d is much\n  scarcer. Although many individuals occasionally feel attracted to \u201copposites\u201d, attractions  between\n  opposites often do not develop into serious intimate relationships and, when they do, these\n  relationships often end prematurely (Felmlee, 2001).\n\n\nThere is a particular area where people often do seek partners different from themselves, that's hot in the field of evolutionary psychology, and is extensively researched &mdash; that would the major\nhistocompatability complex, or MHC, in human mate choice.   The MHC is a genomic region which codes for\nprotein receptors, MHC proteins, which are heavily involved in the immune system and autoimmunity;\nthe body uses them as antigens so that T cells and NK-cells, our immune's system \"policemen\", can\nrecognize foreign elements and differentiate them from \"self\". To protect against the great\ndiversity of bacterial and viral invaders, the MHC genome region needs to be highly polymorphic;\nthat means inbreeding at those loci (by mating with a \"more-alike\" partner) would be deleterious and\nevolutionarily disfavored because inbreeding homogenizes alleles, which in turns means that mating with an \"alike\" individual would decrease the recognition ability of their offspring to detect pathogens. Thus, research often finds that humans often favor\ndissimilar MHC alleles in their mates, which some researchers have hypothesized is mediated through\nolfaction.  Here is the abstract of one such study finding these preferences:\n\n\n  Preferences for mates that possess genes dissimilar to one's own at the major histocompatibility\n  complex (MHC), a polymorphic group of loci associated with the immune system, have been found in\n  mice, birds, fish, and humans. These preferences may help individuals choose genetically compatible\n  mates and may adaptively function to prevent inbreeding or to increase heterozy-gosity and thereby\n  immunocompetence of offspring. MHC-dissimilar mate preferences may influence the psychology of\n  sexual attraction. We investigated whether MHC similarity among romantically involved couples (N =\n  48) predicted aspects of their sexual relationship. All women in our sample normally ovulated, and\n  alleles at three MHC loci were typed for each person. As the proportion of MHC alleles couples\n  shared increased, women's sexual responsivity to their partners decreased, their number of extrapair\n  sexual partners increased, and their attraction to men other than their primary partners increased,\n  particularly during the fertile phase of their cycles.\n\n\nOther than that, I can't think of anything else; the rule is pretty much, like attracts like.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3099#3100", "answerId": "3100"}

There are no units measuring beauty, that I am aware of. \n\nIn social sciences, when the attractiveness of an individual has to be rated, it is rated on a scale where, for example, one would mean low attractiveness and five high attractiveness. Under such scales, everyone in the study would literally have to be of a 5/5 attractiveness and yet rate themselves as a 1/5 attractiveness. That's highly unlikely, to say the least. Thus, I'm inclined to dismiss the notion that we see ourselves five times more attractive than we are as bogus.\n\nLeaving at that, however, is leaving much unanswered. There is, I think, a vaguer but still quite interesting claim to investigate: Do we overestimate our own attractiveness?\n\nThat question has an answer, and the answer is yes.\n\nAccording to the authors of The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us, relating the findings of Narcissistic Illusions in Self-Evaluations of Intelligence and Attractiveness,\n\n\n  Evidence about self-judged attractiveness comes from a study of college students in which men judged themselves to be about 15 percent more attractive than they actually were. Women viewed themselves as slightly less attractive than they actually were, although both men and women viewed themselves as above average in attractiveness (the women in the study were judged to be a little more above average in attractiveness).\n\n\nThe study itself is unfortunately locked behind a paywall, but the abstract does support this:\n\n\n  Both males and females overestimated their own intelligence, with males, but not females, also overestimating their attractiveness. ... Males showed greater positive illusions than females, with this effect at least partly attributable to observed gender differences in narcissism\n\n\nThe theory that we overestimate our own beauty is supported by another study: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: Enhancement in Self-Recognition. \n\nResearchers took photos of undergraduate students and then invited those students back to the laboratory two to four weeks later to identify their face out of an assortment of eleven images. Out of those eleven pictures, five were altered to make the subject less attractive than the original and five were altered to make the subject more attractive. The eleventh one was the original, unaltered picture\n\nThe result? The majority of participants picked one of the pictures that was altered to be more attractive than the original picture, overestimating the attractiveness by six to twelve percent.\n\nThe researchers then did a similar experiment, but this time they asked the participants to evaluate friends and strangers, in order to see if we also overestimate other people's attractiveness or only our own. In the end, subjects overestimated their friend's attractiveness but not the stranger's.\n\nTL;DR: We do overestimate our own beauty, but not by anything close to a magnitude of five times. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7461#7492", "answerId": "7492"}

Now articles all over the Internet use the wrong data, attribute it to the reliable source (that never said anything like it), and don't do any verification on their own.\n\n\n\nThe real source of the 8% number appears to be a survey conducted by Stephen Shapiro, a management consultant, author, and speaker, and published in an article on his website. According to him,\n\n\n  Only 8% of people are always successful in achieving their resolutions. 19% achieve their resolutions every other year.  49% have infrequent success.  24% (one in four people) NEVER succeed and have failed on every resolution every year. That means that 3 out of 4 people almost never succeed.\n\n\nOf course, \"Only 8% of people are always successful in achieving their resolutions\" is not the same as \"8% of People Achieve Their New Year's Resolutions\". The study by Shapiro has not been published in a scientific journal.\n\n\n\nIn general, the numbers on the Statistics Brain page come from multiple sources:\n\nThe \"News Years Resolution Statistics\" table, \"Age Success Rates\" table, and \"Type of Resolutions\" table on Statistics Brain come from the Stephen Shapiro article (but sometimes with errors, e.g. leaving out the \"always\" in the statement regarding the 8% number.)\n\nStatistics Brain cites \"University of Scranton. Journal of Clinical Psychology\" as the source for the entire page.

How to use Behavioral Principles to actually stick to those resolutions:\n\n\n  University of Scranton research shows that approximately 45% of individuals in the United States make New Year\u2019s Resolutions, unfortunately,  this research also suggests that just 8% of people achieve their New Year\u2019s goals by the end of the calendar year (Norcross, Mrykalo, &amp; Blagys, 2002).\n  \n  Norcross, J.

Journal of Clinical Psychology, 58 (4), 397-405. DOI: 10.1002/clp.1151\n\n\nHowever, the paper by Norcross, Mrykalo, and Blagys concludes that many New Years' resolutions are successful:\n\n\n  Contrary to widespread public opinion, a considerable proportion of New Year resolvers do in fact succeed, at least in the short run. This and previous longitudinal research can counterbalance the ubiquitous contention that \u201cresolutions never succeed\u201d (Goll-witzer, 1999) or, in the words of Oscar Wilde (1909) in The Picture of Dorian Gray, the origin of resolutions \u201cis pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil.\u201d Although the success rates of New Year\u2019s resolutions obviously depend on the interval and criteria considered,the proportion of self-reported continuous success was 46% at six months.\n\n\n(This 46% number is reflected on the Statistics Brain page under \"Resolution maintained... Past six months).\n\nThey do, however, note:\n\n\n  The success rates reported in this study are probably overestimates for several reasons. First, although we tried to recruit an unbiased community sample via telephone, the sample is nonetheless composed of volunteers. Only 31% of those contacted agreed to participate, and those who volunteered may have been more likely to be successful in their resolutions. Second, the self-report outcomes of resolvers (and perhaps nonresolvers) may be inflated. This observation is supported by the quantitative data, which shows a modest reduction in the target behaviors (average reduction of 23 to 15 cigarettes per day and an average weight loss of 8 lb from January to July). Third, all of the data are\n  based on self-report without independent verification. And fourth, our criteria of \u201cmostly successful\u201d and \u201ctotally successful\u201d may be too lenient. The demand characteristics of the study probably pose the most serious threat to its validity.\n\n\nIt's also plausible that disclosing their resolution to a researchers, and knowing that the researcher would follow up, affected the success rate of the resolvers.\n\nThe Forbes article with the 8% number later links to an interview Norcross did on NPR. In that NPR interview, he said\n\n\n  FLATOW: I was surprised in reading your paper about actually how many people are successful in...\n  \n  NORCROSS: Oh, yes. We say the glass is proverbial, half-empty or half-full, here.\n  \n  (LAUGHTER)\n  \n  NORCROSS: In two of our longitudinal studies, 40 to 46 percent of New Year's resolvers will be successful at six months. So, the half empty is, it's true, most people fail. But 40 to 46 percent is pretty impressive. Particularly when you compare it to the people who don't try and therefore have, in our research, 0 to 4 percent chance.\n\n\nMarist has been collecting data on New Years' resolutions since the 90s.

We performed a review of the literature during the past forty years to assess this paradox. We used PubMed, EconLit and Jstor to locate all peer-reviewed English-language articles presenting data analysis on mortality associated with doctors' strikes. We identified 156 articles, seven of which met our search criteria. The articles analyzed five strikes around the world, all between 1976 and 2003. The strikes lasted between nine days and seventeen weeks. All reported that mortality either stayed the same or decreased during, and in some cases, after the strike. None found that mortality increased during the weeks of the strikes compared to other time periods. The paradoxical finding that physician strikes are associated with reduced mortality may be explained by several factors. Most importantly, elective surgeries are curtailed during strikes. Further, hospitals often re-assign scarce staff and emergency care was available during all of the strikes. Finally, none of the strikes may have lasted long enough to assess the effects of long-term reduced access to a physician. Nonetheless, the literature suggests that reductions in mortality may result from these strikes.\n\n\nWith the following reasoning:\n\n\n  In spite of the limitations of the studies, the fact that several studies using different methods in different setting found consistent results suggests that they may indeed be capturing a phenomenon. The findings raise important issues regarding the appropriate levels of health care. They highlight the risks of elective surgeries, which may actually increase mortality. They also highlight the possibility that an over-supply of doctors may not increase patient survival and may introduce inefficiencies into health care. In summary, the selective withdrawal of services by various health care workers for relatively short period of time does not appear to adversely influence mortality.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nOne objection that may be raised against the paper cited is the ratio of 156 studies found that matched the systematic search criteria terms vs apparently only 7 studies evaluated meeting the systematic search criteria qualities. Some studies were of too low quality and since doctors usually do not strike; when they do this it is a highly unusual event with potentially very interesting effects to observe (witness the OP's question) and therefore under immense scrutiny leading to several papers covering one and the same event.\n\nA doctor's job is difficult and burdened with immense responsibility. For every treatment there are effects and side-effects to be considered, a cost benefit analysis to be performed. Ideally, routinely.\n\nThe main effects found are theorised to be split into several parts: \nThere are systemic effects inherent to a profit oriented system leading to (wholly) unnecessary treatments (one part because of greed in the system, one part wrong incentives to those involved and too much stress piled onto the decision makers). This is despicable in nature and in principle, although it may just not be realised by most doctors in each individual case presented to them. This should be, and presumably is, the smallest contributing factor and at the same time the main driving point given as surrounding context for the claim.\n\nDoctors very seldom do harm on purpose, as this statistic cited above might suggest.\nCritical health care, like countering a heart attack, was still provided in every case examined, as the Hippocratic Oath prescribes.\n(\"a doctors\u2019 strike involving the withdrawal of some non-emergency services does not necessarily lead to increased mortality.\") \nMany doctors do not adhere to the strict strike definition that would be expected from a workers' trade union.\n\nA systematic over-provisioning and resulting health care system inefficiencies as well as their associated negative outcomes are probable and likely reduced (e.g.: \"during this strike, the residents were replaced with staff physicians, so the care provided may have actually been more experienced.\"). \n\nThe main death toll reduction was assumed to be caused in a short time frame from cessation of elective surgeries were risks are often immediately realised but benefits only potential and later to be observed. This was probably the biggest contributing factor in the cases surveyed.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nApparently yes, in the short time frame of such a rare strike and shortly thereafter the overall mortality rate remains the same or declines. However, the actual circumstances seem to suggest that this is not so much evidence for more harming patients (on purpose) than doing good. It is more an indication of several inherent limits of the way the health-care systems are organised.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/39614#39615", "answerId": "39615"}

{"question": "Is ocean acidification happening?", "questionId": "20101", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20101", "category": "climate-change", "categoryId": 1, "answer": "As far as I know, nobody is claiming that ocean acidification will result in the pH going lower than 7, so this is at best a straw man.  The IPCC project a reduction by 0.3 - 0.4 units by 2100 (e.g. AR4 WG1 report) (current pH is about 8.14).  The pH does not need to fall as far as 7 for there to be substantial impacts (see the three sources given for details).\n\nI suspect this is just silly pedantry on the grounds that a pH greater than 7 is alkaline, so it is inaccurate to say that it isn't ocean acidification but ocean dealkalinisation.  However this is bogus as pH is getting more acidic and less alkaline as the pH drops, so it is perfectly correct to say that the oceans are becoming more acidic, even if the pH remains higher than 8.  It is a bit like defining \"hot\" as meaning above 0C and \"cold\" as below 0C and then complaining when someone describes a change from 2C to 1C as \"becoming colder\" and insisting on it being described as \"becoming less warm\".\n\nThe glossary of the IPCC A4 report defines ocean acidification as \"A decrease in the pH of seawater due to the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide\", so they make it very clear that they mean only a decrease in pH.  Scientific terminology varies from field to field, if you want to understand the science, you do need to understand the terminology used in that field and not to try to impose your own definitions on what they have said.\n\nHaving now seen the video, my suspicion was entirely correct.  The OED defines \"acidification\" as \"The action or process of making something (more) acidic; conversion into an acid; addition of acid. Cf. acidify v.\".  The inclusion of \"(more)\" means that the scientists use of the term is completely in accordance with normal English usage.  Senator Ericksen at about 1:03:15 makes a comment that suggests that he understands that \"less alkaline\" and \"more acidic\" means essentially the same thing.\n\nBTW, a pH of 8.2 is not \"strongly alkaline\" as Easterbrook states, that is just hyperbole.  If seawater is \"strongly alkaline\", one wonders how he would describe drain cleaner! ;o)\n\nHaving looked at the video again, excluding the pedantry issue, Easterbrook only makes one scientific argument, which happens to be incorrect (which makes it rather ironic he described it as Chemistry 101 ;o).  He states \"The effect of global warming is to make the oceans more alkaline, not more acidic, because warming drives CO2 out of the oceans\".  Now it is true that the solubility of CO2 in water decreases with increasing temperature, but that is only part of Henry's law the other part is that the solubility depends on the difference in partial pressure in the atmosphere and the concentration in the water (the constant of proportionality depends on temperature).  So increasing temperatures will have the effect of reducing solubility, but the increasing partial pressure of CO2 will have the opposite effect, tending to increase solubility.  Which effect is strongest?  Well the fact that the oceans are acidifying (rather than becoming more alkaline as Easterbrook predicts) and that atmospheric CO2 levels are rising at only about half the rate of anthropogenic emissions is very strong evidence that the oceans are taking up large amounts of CO2.  It is the interplay of these two factors that to a large extent explains why CO2 levels have been so stable for the last million years, the pre-industrial equilibrium is the point where these two influences balance.\n\nThere is a good series of articles on Ocean Acidification at SkepticalScience.com, written by Doug Mackie that sets out the basics in some detail.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20101#20102", "answerId": "20102"}

To start with, the risk part you quote is certainly an unlucky choice; if people are dying of starvation, it's not a risk, but a tragedy. Let's start by changing the question to Are people dying of starvation because we cannot produce enough food?\n\nNow, this can have two meanings:\n\n\nIs enough food being produced worldwide for everyone to have enough to stay alive?\nThe answer to this one seems to be yes. Although I could not find the original FAO statement, most reputable sources (e.g. the WPF, Oxfam and others) agree that there would be enough to go around (although, once again, I have not found a publication with a clear source indication for this statement).\nWould producing more food mean less starvation?\nThe answer to this one is also yes. The FAO, among many others, has clear recommendations which include a significant growth of agricultural production to ward off famines and starvation now and in the future.\n\n\nIn fact, you can more easily see the (false) dichotomy when you imagine two extreme scenarios. In the first, the world produces exactly as much food as is needed for everyone to have just enough to eat. You could say that any occurring starvation would be only a result of mismanagement; however, it is obvious that an absolutely perfect distribution is impossible - if one egg is dropped somewhere in the world, someone goes hungry. On the other hand, if every town and village produces a hundred times as much food as it needs, there is hardly any chance for even the grossest mismanagement or inequality to produce hunger.\n\nTo sum up: the worldwide food situation is influenced by many factors, and both production and distribution are among them (in fact, the FAO report cited above has six groups of security indicators: availability, physical access, economic access, utilization, vulnerability, and shocks). It is an almost undisputed consensus view that we could significantly reduce or even eliminate malnutrition by, among other measures, redistributing the existing supplies. However, it is equally clear that we could reach the same goals by increasing food production. Which of these is the better way is a matter of dispute, with most organizations (such as the UNICEF, Oxfam or FAO) suggesting a combined approach.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20459#20488", "answerId": "20488"}

Protection offered by alcohol consumption of &lt;50 g/d appeared to act through inhibition of the injurious action of high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol [1].\n\n\nThis is sustained by epidemiologic data, however the mechanism remains unclear:\n\n\n  Epidemiologic data generally show an inverse correlation between coronary heart disease risk and moderate alcohol intake (variously defined but generally corresponding to 2 to 4 drinks per day). ... The mechanism by which moderate alcohol intake \"protects\" remains unclear. Perhaps the best available hypothesis relates to the increased concentration of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol associated with moderate alcohol intake. However, it should be stressed that we are still uncertain about the mechanisms linking a high HDL level to protection against coronary heart disease. If a high HDL level is only a marker (and not directly protective), raising HDL levels need not confer protection. Alcoholism, on the other hand, is associated with marked elevation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and is among the most common causes of hypertriglyceridemia [2].\n\n\nSo it increases blood triglycerides. And it is also a risk factor for hypertension:\n\n\n  There was an increased risk of hypertension in those who consumed large amounts of ethanol (>/=210 g per week) compared with those who did not consume alcohol over the 6 years of follow-up [3].\n\n\nAlthough moderate alcohol consumption may protect against atherosclerosis, it promotes other cardiovascular diseases. Other factors should be taken into account too:\n\n\n  The robust relationship between moderate drinking and lower risk of cardiovascular disease remains an intriguing area of investigation. ... Moderate alcohol use also has important inverse relations with inflammatory factors. ... The non-alcoholic constituents of red wine also have anti-atherogenic and perhaps even life-extending properties in vitro, but their relevance to humans remains uncertain.

Schein's Coercive Persuasion (1961)\nThe documentary They Chose China, which is freely available online\nSkeptoid podcast \n\n\nThe books do describe a top-down command from Mao Zedong that non-Communists must be put through a \"re-education\" process, but this order was enacted in very different ways throughout China at the time, mostly with no success. It was in Korean POW camps that it found the greatest success of perhaps a half-dozen permanent converts. Why was that? According to these sources, the Korean War POWs faced a perfect storm which made conversion to the other side especially appealing:\n\n\nThe Korean War was not a very popular war, as America wanted to return to peacetime society after WW2. The soldiers did not know America's justification for war, and they knew very little about the Chinese. Some had never finished school, were first-generation immigrants, or were unfamiliar with the concept of ideology. They were led blindly into an unwanted war, and the Chinese argued that communism was the way to peace.\nFrom 1951 to 1953, POWs were kept in starvation level conditions against the Geneva Convention. In 1953, the camps were handed over to the Chinese, and the POWs were quite surprised to be referred to as \"students\" rather than \"prisoners\" and treated with dignity. Those who defected had generally expected to die and found life under the Chinese surprisingly tolerable.\nBecause Army regulations were not yet clear on the extent of cooperation with the enemy that was permissible, the POWs were uncertain where to draw the line. The Code of Conduct was later drawn up because of this.\nChinese \"educators\" spoke to the POWs reasonably. Most were unconvinced regardless, but a few started to become interested in what they were saying, for example Clarence Adams: \n\n\nThe scientific evidence shows that what the American press called \"brainwashing\" was merely \"coercive persuasion,\" persuasion techniques backed with the promise of reward and the threat of punishment. It did not turn people into zombies or robots. Many of the defectors, including Clarence Adams, eventually renounced Communism and returned to the US (see Skeptoid podcast), and more violent persuasion techniques elsewhere in China produced effects more similar to torture.\n\nI did not look into the Japanese situation in depth but it appears to have been similar to Korea: soldiers expecting continued pain and death were treated well instead, and asked mainly to give a fair hearing to the perspective of their Chinese caretakers. Japanese soldiers had been taught that the Chinese they killed were barbaric devils, so the permanent change of heart that ensued is not too surprising.\n\nIn conclusion, \"brainwashing\" is not too far from \"Stockholm syndrome,\" and both are simply mildly effective ways to make captives pay attention to their captors.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/37672#37784", "answerId": "37784"}

From the testing device used, this appears to be in the 40 Hz\u20131 Khz range, far below wifi/cellphone radiation and rather in the range of alternating current power.\n\nThe original publication is:\n\nDe-Kun Li, Hong Chen, Jeannette R. Ferber, Roxana Odouli &amp; Charles Quesenberry.  Exposure to Magnetic Field Non-Ionizing Radiation and the Risk of Miscarriage: A Prospective Cohort Study.  In: Scientific Reports 7, Article number: 17541 (2017), doi:10.1038/s41598-017-16623-8. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16623-8\n\n\n  After controlling for multiple other factors, women who were exposed to higher MF levels had 2.72 times the risk of miscarriage (hazard ratio = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.42\u20135.19) than those with lower MF exposure. The increased risk of miscarriage associated with high MF was consistently observed regardless of the sources of high MF. The association was much stronger if MF was measured on a typical day of participants\u2019 pregnancies.\n\n\nThe paper notes that the study included 1054 pregnant women.  The study focussed on the highest levels of magnetic field exposure.  The paper claims that the study corrected for maternal age, race, education, smoking during pregnancy, prior miscarriage, maternal income, marital status, maternal nausea/vomiting, alcohol use, caffeine intake, maternal fever, vaginal bleeding, urinary tract infection, carrying loads > 10 pounds, exposure to solvents or degreasers, vitamin intake, and Jacuzzi/hot tub/steam room/sauna use during pregnancy.  They consider magnetic fields from all emitting sources, thus not specifically from WiFi and mobile phone use, such as the Mirror incorrectly claims.\n\nAlso from the paper:\n\n\n  Although we did not have information on the exact sources from which MF was generated, based on participants\u2019 diary, we were able to examine whether MF exposure was from any of the following location categories: at home, at home in bed, at work, in transit, or from other sources. The association was observed consistently, regardless of the location.\n\n\nThis study thus did observe a correlation.  However, remember that correlation does not imply causation.  Critically, the paper does no attempt to suggest any physical mechanism that may cause the observed correlation.  Therefore, causation is not established.\n\nI lack the medical domain expertise to otherwise judge the merits of the paper, but Scientific Reports is a reputable journal published by the Nature group, so there should be some peer review that filters out the junk (and the paper does not appear to be junk).  Note that Scientific Reports should not be confused with the actual journal Nature, which is much more prestiguous and harder to get into.  Finally, I will quote an insightful comment by MB made on the actual article:\n\n\n  The effect of the frequency of the magnetic field was not analyzed (which would be important to look for possible biomedical mechanism) and the frequency range of the device is not stated in the manuscript. Looking up the measurement device one finds a measurement frequency range of 40-1000Hz. Therefore only claims for this frequency range can be made. It is also surprising that the values reported are so small (range of a few hundred nano Tesla) - where even the solar radiation during strong magnetic storm are up to 500nT and also power lines, vakuum cleaner, hair dryer, etc typically produce way larger magnetic field.\n  The authors do not even discuss this discrepancy in expected values and reported values.\n\n\nIndeed, the range of 40\u20131000Hz has nothing to do with wifi or cellphones, so this does raise the question what exactly the authors are talking about.\n\n\n\nP.S. Kudos to The Mirror for providing enough information to find the original article.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40218#40219", "answerId": "40219"}

In general, results suggest that (a) religious involvement is moderately and significantly associated with health status and psychological well-being; (b) these associations withstand controlling for effects of key sociodemographic constructs such as age, race, and gender; (c) these associations emerge across a variety of indicators; and (d) results are present, though inconsistent, across samples drawn from three large-scale national probability surveys conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. (SOURCE)\n\n\nThis is a meta-analysis of several surveys from the 70s and 80s, so the data may not be representative of society today. There are some caveats provided in the discussion, as well, such as that one set of data did favor the correlation between religiosity and health, but not religiosity and psychological well-being.\n\n\nAbdel-Khalek, Mental Health, Religion, &amp; Culture -- \"Happiness, health, and religiosity: Significant relations\" (2006):\n\n\n\n  Based on the self-rating scales, the current data provide strong evidence that, among a large sample of Kuwaiti Muslim undergraduate students, religious people are happier.\n  \n  ...the main predictor of happiness was mental health. So, the self-rating of religiosity came as a predictor of happiness, but to a lesser degree. (SOURCE)\n\n\n\nRoss, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion -- \"Religion and Psychological Distress\" (1990):\n\n\n\n  The positive emotional function of religion has been well accepted, but the evidence has not been conclusive. Furthermore, research has rarely made explicit comparisons to persons who claim to have no religion. Using a representative sample of Illinois residents (and controlling for sociodemographics and willingness to express feelings), I found that the stronger a person's religious belief, the lower the level of psychological distress. (SOURCE)\n\n\nThis is an old study, and featured in a journal with a title that may reveal an agenda. I can't be sure, but at least want to mention it. I would be thrilled to see a footnotes for the statement that \"the positive emotional function of religion has been well accepted...\" That might provide many more sources for this claim.\n\n\nLevin, Social Science &amp; Medicine -- \"Religion and health: Is there an association, is it valid, and is it causal?\" (2002):\n\n\n\n  This paper reviews evidence for a relationship between religion and health. Hundreds of epidemiologic studies have reported statistically significant, salutary effects of religious indicators on morbidity and mortality. However, this does not necessarily imply that religion influences health; three questions must first be answered: \u201cIs there an association?\u201d, \u201cIs it valid?\u201d, and, \u201cIs it causal?\u201d Evidence presented in this paper suggests that the answers to these respective questions are \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cprobably,\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d (SOURCE)\n\n\n\nChida, Steptoe, Powell, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics -- \"Religiosity/Spirituality and Mortality\" (2008):\n\n\n\n  The results of the meta-analyses showed that religiosity/spirituality was associated with reduced mortality in healthy population studies... but not in diseased population studies. (SOURCE)\n\n\nI realize this is not a psychological benefit, but still found it interesting, and it appears (from the comments) that your original question may have included requests for examining correlation between religion and other benefits as well.\n\n\nDavidson et al., Psychosomatic Medicine -- \"Alterations in Brain and Immune Function Produced by Mindfulness Meditation\" (2003)\n\n\n\n  We report for the first time significant increases in left-sided anterior activation, a pattern previously associated with positive affect, in the meditators compared with the nonmeditators. We also found significant increases in antibody titers to influenza vaccine among subjects in the meditation compared with those in the wait-list control group. Finally, the magnitude of increase in left-sided activation predicted the magnitude of antibody titer rise to the vaccine. (SOURCE)\n\n\nI was actually forwarded this study a few weeks ago and list it here to show that while the literature suggests that religion does have a positive effect on health and psychological states, so does mindfulness/meditation. Davidson also gives a talk entitled, \"Be Happy Like a Monk\" -- one can watch it or request the transcript HERE, if interested.\n\n\n\nJust for some counter-points, I thought I'd list these:\n\n\nEffects of participation in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) (LINK):\n\n\n\n  Affiliation with AA after treatment was related to maintenance of self-efficacy and motivation, as well as to increased active coping efforts.\n\n\nI offer this simply to illustrate that (as Levin's paper about causality also aims at), it might not be merely religion that improves psychological conditions, but the aspects of social bonding, support, being accepted, having an important goal, a common purpose, etc.\n\n\nPaul, Journal of Religion &amp; Society -- \"Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous Democracies\" (2005):\n\n\n\n  In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies (Figures 1-9). The most theistic prosperous democracy, the U.S., is exceptional, but not in the manner Franklin predicted. The United States is almost always the most dysfunctional of the developed democracies, sometimes spectacularly so, and almost always scores poorly.\n\n\nI add this, as these individual effects of religiosity may be measurable, but perhaps religiosity on the societal level, or at least various forms of it, are not correlated in the same manner, at least with external/societal benefits.\n\n\n\nAs always, correlation does not equal causation. While there is evidence supporting the claim examined here, the fact that it doesn't seem to matter which religion it is, that AA may have such benefits, and that individual benefits doesn't scale as a society makes me want to look further. I'd be particularly interested in the Levin paper above, for the abstract also contains this:\n\n\n  Third, alternative explanations for observed associations between religion and health are described.\n\n\nFinding this and other papers looking at similar things might be quite interesting, unless the only question of interest here is purely about religion/health/well-being. Personally, I'd like to know the underlying mechanisms as well, as the benefits of religion might be reducible to lower factors that could prove useful.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4588#4590", "answerId": "4590"}

The thermometer today measured 50\u00b0 in the sun. Mrs. Guilly, 40, died of sunstroke.\n\n\nNote the key phrase \"in the sun\". (The paper you mention explicitly states that the Paris temperature recording was made in the shade, as opposed to direct sunlight.) None of the newspapers give additional information about the measurement (e.g. how long the thermometer was exposed for, was it near other heat sources, etc.). Without knowing whether the reading was contaminated, it seems unfair to claim that the measurement then should get the record. Indeed, if the measurement was taken in the Sun, that should make the measured temperature hotter than the actual air temperature, contaminating the dataset. It's recommended to place a thermometer in the shade for accurate temperature measurements - and the Saint-Etienne reading did not, apparently, come from that.\n\nIn particular, an official temperature measurement should use a thermometer in a Stevenson screen (thanks, David Hammen). The ideal height is 1.25 to 2 meters off the ground, and the instrument should obviously be placed in an area that has the same average temperature as the region it's trying to represent. L'Express du Midi implies that a Stevenson screen was not used at Saint-Etienne, and it's quite possible that other modern recommendations were not obeyed. Notably - and ironically - the Watts Up With That article does show a thermometer in a Stevenson screen, as it should be. Official temperature measurements use Stevenson screens.\n\nIt's also worth noting that none of the temperature record I've found for Saint-Etienne from 1930 shows this data point; indeed, it seems that the temperature didn't deviate from the average significantly. While June seems to have been one of the hottest months on average that year, there's no enormous outlier shown - possibly because the measurement was likely performed incorrectly.\n\nAdditional sources: Fake Investigation, ClimateState.com\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44309#44310", "answerId": "44310"}

{"question": "Do children who kill animals turn out to be violent?", "questionId": "4540", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4540", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Basically, yes, there's a correlation. Keeping in mind Oddthinking's comment on the value of such non-random samples, this is where most of the correlational data comes from, e.g.:\n\n\n  A history of childhood cruelty to animals and contemporary patterns of\n  chronic interpersonal aggression has been documented in assaultive incarcerated\n  offenders, perpetrators of sexual homicides, rapists, and child\n  molesters (Felthous, 1980; Felthous &amp; Yudowitz, 1997; Kellert &amp; Felthous,\n  1985; Merz-Perez, Heide, &amp; Silverman, 2001; Ressler, Burgess, &amp; Douglas,\n  1988; Tingle, Barnard, Robbins, Newman, &amp; Hutchinson, 1986), making a\n  case for the potential prognostic value of childhood animal cruelty.\n\n\nAs to what is the ultimate cause however, it's nowhere near as simple as MSalters' answer makes it to be, i.e. [lack of] empathy is not the only cause, although it does play a role:\n\n\n  animal abuse was negatively associated with affective empathy and national culture\n\n\nChildhood animal cruelty (CAC) is also correlated with [prior] exposure to interpersonal and animal violence (same source):\n\n\n  Rural adolescents were more likely to abuse animals and had higher exposure to domestic violence, which (in turn) was associated with more animal abuse. \n\n\nAnd as to whether CAC has better predictive value than these other associates... one review says no. Quoting from the first paper:\n\n\n  In a recent review of research on children who are cruel to animals,\n  McPhedran (2009) concluded that the home environment is generally a better\n  predictor of the development of adult violence than childhood cruelty to\n  animals and we should not infer that animal cruelty leads to other antisocial\n  behaviors throughout development. McPhredran suggested that the context\n  within which cruelty to animals occurs is most likely the common factor, and\n  that the complex nature of abusive home environments and experiences that\n  contribute to behavioral problems and interpersonal violence should be an\n  important target of our interventions.\n\n\nciting\n\n\n  McPhedran, S. (2009). Animal abuse, family violence, and child wellbeing: A review. Journal of Family Violence, 24, 41\u201352.\n\n\nAlas all review works in this area seem to be of the narrative kind, so the quality of inference (one way or the other) is likely to be biased.\n\nMcPhedran's review seems to be talking at some length about what appears to be the New South Wales study that prompted your question, and Oddthinking's comments (on the lack of controls etc.) are reflected in McPhedran's review as:\n\n\n  Although Gullone and Clarke (2006)\n  contend that there appears to be a greater likelihood that\n  people alleged to have abused animals will engage in\n  offenses against the person when compared to all alleged\n  offenders, they did not specify the order of offending. Thus\n  it cannot be concluded that animal cruelty preceded other\n  offenses.\n  It must also be noted that although 25% of animal abuse\n  offenders committed offenses against the person, this\n  entails that 75% of animal abusers did not commit offenses\n  of that nature. It is acknowledged that offenses may have\n  been committed but not detected by police, but it should\n  also be considered that this appears an insufficient\n  explanation to account for the entire 75% of animal abusers\n  who did not commit offenses against the person. Therefore,\n  the findings simply support existing evidence that animal\n  cruelty, and particularly the deliberate infliction of unnecessary\n  physical pain or suffering, may occur in conjunction\n  with a wider range of antisocial behaviors.\n  Similar patterns of generalized criminality among animal\n  cruelty offenders have been noted in New South Wales,\n  Australia (Gullone and Clarke 2006). The range of criminal\n  behaviors performed by persons in New South Wales Police\n  databases with a record of animal abuse averaged four\n  different types of criminal offence. Assault, followed by\n  stealing, driving offences, and domestic violence were the\n  most common forms of crime committed by animal cruelty\n  offenders in New South Wales who had other criminal\n  charges. However, the New South Wales animal cruelty\n  offender statistics were not compared against a wider\n  sample of offenders without a history of animal cruelty.\n  Therefore, it cannot be concluded that patterns of generalized\n  criminal offending among animal cruelty offenders\n  differed from patterns of generalized criminal offending\n  either overall or among offenders who did not commit\n  animal cruelty.\n\n\nMcPhedran also critiques the lack of operational definition for animal cruelty in some of the research in this area.\n\nAnd this is in fairly strong contrast with a paper by Simmons et al. (2014), which although is not centered on [interpersonal] violence, does make pretty bold claims as to the predictive value of animal cruelty and appears to have decently large and representative samples:\n\n\n  The objective of this study was to document the long-term relationship between youthful animal abuse and a variety of problem behavior outcomes later in life. Data were used from a national, longitudinal, and multigenerational sample collected by the National Youth Survey Family Study, which assessed families across 27 years from 1977 to 2004. The analytic sample consisted of 2538 individuals who were analyzed using multivariate ordinary least squares and logistic regression modeling that controlled for important demographic factors.  Hypotheses were tested across two generations separately showing that a history of animal abuse does, indeed, predict later problem behaviors, including serious offending, marijuana use, other drug use, alcohol use, and deviant beliefs. Depending on the outcome examined, each model accounts for 5\u201334% of the variation in respondents\u2019 problem behaviors. Within each model, animal abuse was often one of the strongest predictors. \n\n\nSo what to conclude from all this? Low quality primary studies leave substantial leeway for investigators or reviewers to interpret the data according to their own predispositions or agendas. Also, since all these studies are observational, you can never rule out all confounders etc. What's the best predictor may depend on what you included or not in the model etc. So big grain of salt prescribed for the reader and perhaps more research needed.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4540#41571", "answerId": "41571"}

Moreover, the personnel of Algorithm and GEN3 Partners currently include 9 TRIZ experts.\n\n\n? \nThat actually explains a lot. \nAlas it does not explain how anything might work in the product.\n\nThey continue:\n\n\n  Healbe applies ground-breaking technology to automatic\n  calorie intake measurement\n  Various attempts to measure glucose concentration through noninvasive methods have been covered in thousands of papers and articles. There are hundreds of projects devoted to this topic.\n  During our time with Algorithm, we combined the advantages of several project groups from various disciplines. This allowed us to integrate into a single whole a keen understanding of such physiological process as glycometabolism, along with the most informative and accessible measurements of health parameters. That is how our water-balance measurement technology was born. This method produced consistent results in the course of testing.\n  Instead of entering the market with a noninvasive blood glucose meter, Healbe chose to use this technology to develop a personal device for monitoring energy intake, consumption, and balance, which is especially important in the process of weight management. \n\n\nSo they do have a technology that claims to measure blood glucose concentration and that while being non-invasive. No more blood pricking. Yay. Quite an achievement! That alone should be a godsend to all those insulin users out there.\n\nSeriously, very seriously: Why not bring that fantastic technology to the market as soon as the patent is granted?\nThat tech is needed! (And others already pointed that out.)\n\nA Series of Doubts:\n\nAmidst all the PR in the above document we find the first part of the answer:\n\n\n  The accuracy rate of glucose concentration calculating methods that this hardware and software system\u2019s computing model is based on (15-20%) are quite enough, in my point of view, for implementation of a device\n  intended for day-to-day applications.\n\n\nA nice opinion, but at least they concluded sensibly:\n\n\n  This is one of the basic technologies that we have developed. GoBe does not display glucose concentration to the user, as our device is not intended for medical use, and doesn\u2019t meet medical accuracy requirements.\n\n\nAdmitting that the method for their device is too inaccurate for medical use means it is just unreliable overall for measuring blood glucose.\n\nMuch worse than the above is what this means for the the accuracy of the device measuring the calorie intake non invasively:\n\nThe current dietary guidelines for the US say that you should eat a varied diet. That is low on added sugar and including fibre, fat and protein. If you eat adequate amounts of carbohydrates the intake is usually not converted into blood glucose, which seems to be the only parameter measured. But these ingredients or meal constituents have a caloric impact!. \n\nUnless they demonstrate in an independent study that different diets are estimated by such a device only halfway convincingly, that is high carb as well low carb for example: this is very likely complete bogus.\n\nA niche application might be: for kids on the night of Halloween that only eat hard candy (chocolate has way too much fat content) this might work within the error range of 15% off.\n\nFrom a review:\n\n\n  For one week, I wore the band every day and simultaneously logged every food I\u2019ve eaten in an old-school calorie-counting app called Lose It. The results were startling: The GoBe was within 10 percent of my calorie tracking estimates every single day of the seven straight days tested, and the average deviation was under 6 percent.\n  It\u2019s worth noting that manual calorie counting isn\u2019t perfect either: When I enter five strips of bacon into the app and it tells me how many calories that food is \u201csupposed\u201d to have, it\u2019s a guess. Does every strip really have exactly 46 calories? Who knows? So GoBe\u2019s deviation from manual calorie counting doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect its accuracy, just how far it is from another flawed metric, which happens to be the next best option for regular folks.\n  GoBe deviated further from this method when it came to the exact grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrates I ate each day, to the tune of 20 to 25 percent on average. For carbs and protein, GoBe typically thought I ate more than Lose It, but for fat, GoBe thought I ate less.\n\n\nAre they nuts?\n\nTouting these claims might gt you into legal trouble. How do they prepare for that:\n\n\n  Why is there a significant difference between the calories I manually calculated and the calories GoBe automatically tracked?\n  It is important to remember that digestion is personal. In fact, some of the food you consume is not digested by your body at all. This largely depends on personal specifics\n  \n  I understand that my body\u2019s glucose levels vary based on what proportion of carbs, protein, and fat I eat. If GoBe uses glucose levels to measure calorie intake, will the accuracy be affected by whether I eat a lot of carbs, protein, or fat?\n  GoBe accurately measure calorie intake from carbs, proteins, and fats. It uses FLOW Technology to analyze changes in your body\u2019s glucose concentration\u2013not by measuring absolute glucose levels. As glucose concentrations rise, cells absorb glucose and release water. GoBe uses an impedance sensor that sends high and low frequency signals through your tissue to measure the fluid moving in and out of your cells. FLOW Technology uses an advanced algorithm to analyze this data and determine calorie intake.\n\n\nThey have tech that is too imprecise to use as a medical device and apply some Big Data calculations to refine these very unreliable measurements. If results are off, it's clearly your own fault. They say so.\n\nAt least they are now wise enough to not answer curious emails from skeptical inquirers, any more. Because they apparently did one time too many:\n\n\n  For example: I asked him how GoBe accounts for the fact that so many calories we consume are locked up in fats and proteins. \u201cProtein is more like \u2018construction material\u2019 for cells,\u201d Shipitsin replied in an email, \u201cand without diets, contribution of protein depend on climate zone and average for U.S. is near 15 to 20 percent... If user using special nutrition like \u2018low-carb\u2019 diets, he or she must set up accordingly flags in app, GoBe change the algorithm accordingly.\u201d\n  Wait, what? What\u2019s all this talk about construction materials and climate zones? Let\u2019s concede there may be a language barrier problem in Shipitsin\u2019s email, and continue on.\n  I also challenged Shipitsin to respond to Robinson\u2019s observation that the relationship between glucose intake and cellular glucose isn\u2019t proportional. To this Shipitsin replied, \u201cYes, of course, your doctor\u2019s absolutely right. You see the main idea\u2014we have exactly \u2018physiological technology.\u2019 GoBe is following the process inside the body and we absolutely aligned with doctors knowledge. We preparing content to Indiegogo\u2019s page with description of technology and internal tests of accuracy. I guess you understand, not only consumers asking us about technology.\u201d \n\n\nSummary\n\nEven in it's current iteration there are systemic and structural limitations of how this might work? As a very large error prone estimate it is a nice idea. Trusting this device is foolish.\n\nWith more sensors, more accurate sensors, to be precise, this might go somewhere. Why not just add an accelerometer to measure your food intake?\n\n\n  A New Method for Measuring Meal Intake in Humans via Automated Wrist Motion Tracking Two tests of the accuracy of our device in counting bites found that our method has 94 % sensitivity in a controlled meal setting and 86 % sensitivity in an uncontrolled meal setting, with one false positive per every 5 bites in both settings. Preliminary data from daily living indicates that bites measured by the device are positively related to caloric intake illustrating the potential of the device to monitor energy intake. \n\n\nSimply estimating the caloric intake seems, for example by just counting bites and swallows,  no less precise than these products. But wait a minute there is more:\nScaling up Dietary Data for Decision-Making in Low-Income Countries: New Technological Frontiers (Advances in Nutrition, 2017):\n\n\n  The GoBe wristband, which needed to be tapped before eating to activate it, used an impedance sensor, an accelerometer, and a pressure sensor.\n\n\nSo they do use an accelerometer! Way to go to measure what a friendly person holds to your mouth and you get to swallow with a straw.\nUnfortunately, the reliability of these technologies are not really assessed:\n\n\n  Third, an assessment of the established validity of these technologies would have been useful but was outside the scope of this review because of space limitations.\n  In summary, although none of the technologies reviewed was immediately fit for \u201cprime time\u201d application in large- scale 24HDR surveys in LICs, the assessment criteria suggested that the computer- and tablet-based programs came closest to fulfilling the criteria set forth by this study. \n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20147#40039", "answerId": "40039"}

My reading is that the study is very cautious not to make any firm claims about infant intelligence being identifiable by common heuristics.\n\nI found there are many supposed signs of superior intelligence on baby-advice sites (see for instance this link) most of which are some form of folk-wisdom.

I think it is important to note that the question of \"Is a woman who dresses sexually suggestively more likely to get raped, at least in some instances\" which is the question being asked from \"Is a woman who dresses sexually suggestively at all to blame if she suffers from rape\" which is often the question people respond to.\n\nThere are many studies showing that people will be more likely to attribute blame to women who are provocatively dressed without saying anything about whether or not the chances of rape are increased in some situations. Those studies are linked in the other answers to this question.\n\nSome studies have shown that provocative dress can have an affect on the likelihood of sexual assault, at least in some instances.\n\nAntecedents of sexual victimization: factors discriminating victims from nonvictims.\n\nSynovitz LB, Byrne TJ., J Am Coll Health.

{"question": "Can coconut oil promote weight loss by increasing metabolism?", "questionId": "12442", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/12442", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "TL;DR = Coconut oil increases metabolism in the sense that it doesn't require your body to perform any additional work to metabolize the energy in the oil. Does it increase your metabolic efficiency overall? No. In fact, greater weight-loss is evident with Long-Chain Triglycerides than with Medium-Chain Triglycerides.\n\nMy emphasis in bold below...\n\n--\n\nMedium chain fatty acids found in coconut oil are absorbed by the GI tract (gastrointestinal) with ease. They do not require any pancreatic enzymes to break them down, which means less work for your pancreas. Next, medium chain fatty acids are shipped to the portal blood stream, directly to the liver, where they go directly into mitochondria without the use of the carnitine palmitoyl transferase, and are immediately oxidized for energy. MCFA (medium chain fatty acids) from coconut oil do not get packaged up with lipoproteins, and do not get transported to a variety of tissues and are not stored as body fat, they go directly to the liver and are metabolized for energy.\n\nSee: (Life Sciences 62 (14): 1203-1215)\n\n\n  In this article, medium chain fatty acids of 8-10 carbon long\n  increases activity of lipase and thus absorb to the intestine at a\n  much faster rate than long chain fatty acids. Study indicated that\n  medium chain fatty acids do not need a lipoprotein for transport but\n  can transport straight to the mitochondria via portal circulation for\n  beta-oxidation. In this paper, other oxidative process such as\n  omega-oxidation and peroxisomal-oxidation occurs in the liver. As seen\n  before, long chain fatty acid need some sort of transport to other\n  organ through the blood. Most often with long chain fatty acids, a\n  carnitine shuttle is required to get the fatty acid into the\n  mitochondria to do beta-oxdation. With medium chain fatty acids, a\n  shuttle is not needed. Energy intake and stored from medium chain\n  fatty acids metabolism is much more sufficient than long chain fatty\n  acids. Appoximately 13% more energy intake compare to long chain fatty\n  *acids* (Papamandjaris, Macdougall, Jones, p. 1209). We see than medium\n  chain fatty acids metabolism is more efficient in which the intake and\n  storing of energy is greater than that of long chain fatty acids.\n\n\nHere is an abstract from another study involving rats:\nClinical Nutrition\nVolume 14, Issue 1, February 1995, Pages 23\u201328\n\n\n  Protein and energy metabolism were examined in 34 partially\n  hepatectomized rats (70%), receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).\n  The TPN contained either long chain triglycerides (LCT) or\n  triglycerides comprising both medium- (MCFA) and long chain fatty\n  acids (LCFA) on the same carbon skeleton (MILT, medium- and long chain\n  triglyceride). The rats were divided into 4 groups with and without\n  glucose (G) supplementation: LCT+G, LCT-G, MLT+G, MLT-G. 3 days after\n  surgery protein synthetic rate in skeletal muscle, as evaluated from\n  in vitro incorporation of 14C-phenylalanine into muscle protein, was\n  significantly higher in rats receiving MLT if compared to rats\n  receiving LCT (p &lt; 0.05). Rats receiving MLT lost significantly less\n  weight during the study period when compared to the LCT group (p &lt;\n  0.005). Increased leucine oxidation was observed in rats receiving TPN without glucose regardless of the type of fat emulsion used (p &lt;\n  0.05). In conclusion, when given to partially hepatectomized rats TPN containing both MCFA and LCFA exerts a stimulatory effect on muscle\n  protein synthesis and preserves body weight better than an emulsion\n  containing LCT only.\n\n\nFor other information concerning Lipids and Energy Storage/Useage, see this wikibooks link.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/12442#12445", "answerId": "12445"}

{"question": "Can fracking help reduce CO2?", "questionId": "43914", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/43914", "category": "climate-change", "categoryId": 1, "answer": "If it replaces coal mining for power production, fracking reduces CO2 emissions, but that's not the whole story. Burning anything results in increased CO2 emissions, and methane leaks in fracked gas infrastructure result in CO2 equivalent emissions that erase the gains in reduced CO2 emissions compared to coal.\n\n\n\nEngel's argument rests on two key assumptions which have turned out true in the case of the U.S., which leads the world in shale gas production:\n\n\nNatural gas replaces coal as a source of electric power.\nThis is basically true. With an aging coal fleet, increasing natural gas-burning generation capacity, and falling power prices, several economists have looked at the direct effects on coal consumption. Numbers vary, but anywhere from 28% to 49% of the reduction in U.S. coal consumption is a direct result of the influx of cheap natural gas caused by the shale gas boom (see also here and here for more nuanced analyses). This means that a world with shale gas burns less coal than one without it.\nPer kWh produced, coal-burning plants emit more CO2 than natural gas-burning plants. This is also true. Per unit of energy, coal produces more than twice as much CO2 as natural gas (source) when burned in a power plant.\n\n\nBut Engel ignores something that recent data is confirming more and more: leaks in natural gas production systems are chronically under-estimated and probably eliminate the GHG-reducing gains made by the shift from coal to natural gas.\n\nThis was documented in an article in Science published in 2018. The article, \"Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain\", is behind a paywall, but Phys.org has a good summary. Here's the most significant finding (emphasis added):\n\n\n  [R]esearchers found most of the emissions came from leaks, equipment malfunctions and other \"abnormal\" operating conditions. The climate impact of these leaks in 2015 was roughly the same as the climate impact of carbon dioxide emissions from all U.S. coal-fired power plants operating in 2015, they found.\n\n\nNet generation from coal and natural gas were roughly equal in 2015, with natural gas increasing and coal decreasing since then.\n\nThe reason for this massive impact, and why leakage is such a concern, is that methane as a greenhouse gas is 34 times more potent than CO2 on a 100-year timescale. And that's just the leaks -- the natural gas still has to be burned, which will produced additional CO2 emissions.\n\nStrictly speaking, if you're intent on digging things up and burning them and all you care about is CO2, then shale gas is better than coal. But it's still putting CO2 into the atmosphere, and if you factor in the global warming potential of leaked methane, it stops looking any better than coal.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/43914#43920", "answerId": "43920"}

The carbon they produce comes from decomposing wood. This carbon came from the atmosphere, and as the wood rots this carbon will wind up back in the atmosphere whether termites eat it or not. Over the lifespan of a tree this is a carbon neutral process, and is accordingly treated as a net zero in global CO2 accounting. So from a global climate point of view the statement is flat wrong.\nTermites produce a mixture of methane and CO2. Methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, but is much less persistent in the atmosphere. For global climate purposes the various greenhouse gasses are counted as the equivalent mass of CO2, but for termite emissions the amounts vary greatly between wet and dry seasons. We don't have good estimates for the global amount, and it would also need to be set against the balance of CO2 and methane that would be produced by other decomposition processes. Complicating this even further is the fact that bacteria in the termite mounds seem to be oxidising anything from 20% to 80% the methane into CO2. So if you are comparing the tailpipe emissions of termites with human industry without regard to the source of the carbon then the answer is \"we don't know\".\nTermites are spreading into new areas due to anthropogenic climate change, and places where they are endemic can also see increases in populations due to tree cutting. So some termite gas production is an indirect result of human activity.\n\n\nLeaving aside all the questions about exactly how much methane and CO2 comes out of termite mounds, the real issue is that we are burning fossil fuels, and hence introducing new carbon into the global carbon cycle, while termites, along with fungi and all the other decomposition processes, merely move the same carbon around the cycle. If all our CO2 came from burning wood or biofuels then we wouldn't have a problem with global warming regardless of the termite population. So the implied statement that termites have a much bigger impact on global climate than human industry is simply wrong.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/45290#45291", "answerId": "45291"}
{"question": "Can mountains on Earth grow higher than 49,000 feet (15,000 m)?", "questionId": "5848", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5848", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "How exactly the different intrinsic and extrinsic factors interplay to shape real mountains is an active field of research. Thus, it's not possible to say exactly how high a mountain could become on earth. However, there are several limits to that.\n\nFirst, there is the issue of rock stability itself. Rock has a limited compressive strength, but quite a bit of weight (relative rock density is on the order of 2.5), so if a mountain becomes too high, the rock at the base will simply crumble or melt from the pressure. \n\nTerzagi (1962); Ge\u0301otechnique, Volume 12, Issue 4, pages 251 \u2013270 calculated the theoretical height of the tallest vertical cliff as H=strength/weight[N/m^3], which comes out to about 7.5 km for granite. Of course, a mountain is not a vertical cliff, and when you double the Granite value, you get the about 15km in the OP (full disclaimer: I'm not 100% sure how exactly adding slopes on the side gets you a factor of 2, but I'm running out of time here). Note that the above formula takes into account the weight of the rock, which means that smaller planets can have higher mountains.\n\nIn reality, these numbers are not readily achievable on earth. There are numerous intrinsic factors that limit rock stability - cracks, folds, etc., as detailed in e.g. Cruden (2003). The shapes of cold, high mountains in sedimentary rocks. Geomorphology 55:249, or in Schmidt and Montgomery (1997). Limits to relief. Science, 270:617. \n\nFurthermore, it has been argued in Brozovitch et al. (1997). Climatic Limits on Landscape Development in the Northwestern Himalaya. Science 276:571 that it is really erosion through glaciation that ends up limiting mountain height.\n\n\n  The interaction between tectonism and erosion produces rugged landscapes in actively deforming regions. In the northwestern Himalaya, the form of the landscape was found to be largely independent of exhumation rates, but regional trends in mean and modal elevations, hypsometry (frequency distribution of altitude), and slope distributions were correlated with the extent of glaciation. These observations imply that in mountain belts that intersect the snowline, glacial and periglacial processes place an upper limit on altitude, relief, and the development of topography irrespective of the rate of tectonic processes operating.\n\n\nThis has recently been supported by Egholm et al. (2009). Glacial effects limiting mountain height. Nature 460:884, who do a more large-scale analysis. The abstract of this paper which summarizes the above much better than I do:\n\n\n  The height of mountain ranges reflects the balance between tectonic rock uplift, crustal strength and surface denudation. Tectonic deformation and surface denudation are interdependent, however, and feedback mechanisms\u2014in particular, the potential link to climate\u2014are subjects of intense debate(1, 2). Spatial variations in fluvial denudation rate caused by precipitation gradients are known to provide first-order controls on mountain range width, crustal deformation rates and rock uplift(3, 4). Moreover, limits to crustal strength(5) are thought to constrain the maximum elevation of large continental plateaus, such as those in Tibet and the central Andes. There are indications that the general height of mountain ranges is also directly influenced by the extent of glaciation through an efficient denudation mechanism known as the glacial buzzsaw(6, 7, 8, 9). Here we use a global analysis of topography and show that variations in maximum mountain height correlate closely with climate-controlled gradients in snowline altitude for many high mountain ranges across orogenic ages and tectonic styles. With the aid of a numerical model, we further demonstrate how a combination of erosional destruction of topography above the snowline by glacier-sliding and commensurate isostatic landscape uplift caused by erosional unloading can explain observations of maximum mountain height by driving elevations towards an altitude window just below the snowline. The model thereby self-consistently produces the hypsometric signature of the glacial buzzsaw, and suggests that differences in the height of mountain ranges mainly reflect variations in local climate rather than tectonic forces.\n\n\nHere's the link to ref#5, which doesn't unfortunately, calculate the maximum theoretical height of a mountain. I guess geologists may mention these things in talks, but not in high-end journal publications. \n\nIn summary: The 15km limit may be plausible, but it's unlikely to ever be attained by real-earth mountains, even the 10km ones that hide from most of erosion in the sea.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5848#5866", "answerId": "5866"}

After a meal the blood pressure decreases a little and the heart rate increases. This is more common to the elders [1]. Food volume and caloric load are important determinants of gastric emptying and postprandial splanchnic hyperaemia, which appears to be a major contributor to hypotension [2]. It seems that postprandial changes in blood pressure are due to the nutrient composition of the meal rather than the actual energy load [3].\n\nSo, in a patient with ischemic cardiopathy or angina a square meal can trigger an infarction due to the increased oxygen needs of the miocardial muscle (increased heart rate) and hypotension. But this has nothing to do with bananas.\n\nMagnesium absorption is not dependent on the stomach. Most studies suggest that Mg is absorbed predominantly in the distal intestine. At usual Mg intakes, Mg absorption occurs primarily by intercellular diffusional and solvent drag mechanisms. There is evidence for a saturable component of Mg absorption in the small intestine and the descending colon that is important at low dietary Mg intakes [4].\n\nA study made on rats suggest that bananas have protective properties on the gastric mucosa not only because of their phosphatidylcholine and pectin content [5]. But bananas contain dopamine at high levels in both the peel and pulp. Dopamine levels ranged from 80-560 mg per 100 g in peel and 2.5-10 mg in pulp, even in ripened bananas ready to eat. Banana is thus one of the antioxidative foods [6]. Dopamine induces acid secretion via activation of the dopamine D1 receptor, located on the cholinergic neurons and on some nonneuronal cells (study was made on rats) [7]. In this way, a banana on an empty stomach may trigger acute episodes of peptic ulcer over chronic lesions.\n\nReferences:\n\n\nWestenend M, Lenders JW, Thien T.

You run along the line, pushing each swing as you go. This will result in each swing being slightly out of phase with the one before it. There will be appear to be a \"wave\" traveling down the line of swings at the same speed that you ran down it. For instance, if you look for a swing that at its maximum displacement (i.e. the farthest forward part the cycle of it swinging back and forth), which swing is displaying that property will change, and this will appear to be a \"thing\" that's moving through the line at the speed you ran past. \n\nFor instance, suppose the swings are 1m apart, and each swing is 1s behind the previous one. Then it will look like there's a wave moving at 1m/s. But what if you set one swing moving, then walk up to the next swing, wait for the previous swing to get through one cycle, and then time your push so that this swing is .01s behind. That is, you push the current swing .01s after the previous swing gets back to its original position. Now the wave will be moving at 100m/s, much faster than you can run.\n\nSimilarly, when light travels through substances, it sets up electromagnetic vibrations. If those phase of those vibrations varies by position, then there will be appear to be a wave moving through the substance, and this wave can travel faster than the speed of light. \n\nHowever, this wave can't be controlled faster than the speed of light. For instance, if you want to set up it up so this wave has a length of one light-second, then it will take at least a second (and the way it works out, it actually takes more) to create the wave, and if you try to send a signal by varying the strength of the wave, it will take at least one second for those changes to propagate to the other end. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/43728#43735", "answerId": "43735"}

If it is overhead on a clear night, away from the brightest city lights you can see it clearly as it sweeps across the sky. The important point is that there is nothing except a satellite that could possible have that kind of movement across the sky. \n\nThe only natural objects in the sky are stars (and galaxies), planets and meteorites. Stars sweep around in 24 hours (the rotation period of the earth). Planets move at almost the same rate as stars - with the naked eye it will take days to see them move relative to the stars. Meteorites on the other hand only take seconds to sweep across the sky, and they rarely go from horizon to horizon; they usually burn up quickly. Satellites on the other hand move majestically across the sky, at a steady pace. Satellites in low orbits (like the ISS) take a couple of minutes to cross from horizon to horizon.\n\nIf you want to know where the ISS is at any time, there are websites that tell you.

{"question": "Is diet soda less healthy than regular soda?", "questionId": "6996", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6996", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Hysteria around the aspartame in diet drinks is not justified by the evidence\n\nIt is quite hard to prove a negative but the simple observation that hundreds of millions of people take aspartame containing drinks every day without apparently causing any notable epidemiological evidence of all the effects should be of some significance. As far as I can tell no such evidence has ever been presented and most of the \"evidence\" is merely anecdotal.\n\nHere is what a 2004 BMJ editorial said about the evidence:\n\n\n  Evidence does not support links between aspartame and cancer, hair loss, depression, dementia, behavioural disturbances, or any of the other conditions appearing in websites. Agencies such as the Food Standards Agency, European Food Standards Authority, and the Food and Drug Administration have a duty to monitor relations between foodstuffs and health and to commission research when reasonable doubt emerges. Aspartame's safety was convincing to the European Scientific Committee on Food in 1988, but proving negatives is difficult, and it is even harder to persuade vocal sectors of the public whose opinions are fuelled more by anecdote than by evidence. The Food Standards Agency takes public concerns very seriously and thus pressed the European Scientific Committee on Food to conduct a further review, encompassing over 500 reports, in 2002. It concluded from biochemical, clinical, and behavioural research that the acceptable daily intake of 40 mg/kg/day of aspartame remained entirely safe\u2014except for people with phenylketonuria.\n\n\nFor those who argue that aspartame releases toxic substances in the body when metabolised (though it is hard to see how natural amino acids are toxic) it is worth bearing in mind the doses involved in typical diet drinks. This lucid explanation and summary of actual evidence appeared in the BMJ in response to some of the more hysterical critics of aspartame who criticised the editorial quoted above (my emphasis):\n\n\n  Mercola talks about \u201cflooding the brain\u201d with amino acids, presupposing that aspartame causes excessive rises in plasma concentrations of phenylalanine that then cross the blood-brain barrier. Plasma phenylalanine rises to 80-120 mmol/l after a protein meal such as a glass of the \u201cnatural substance\u201d milk, about the same as after a dose of 34 mg aspartame per kg body weight (about 28 canned drinks sweetened with aspartame consumed at once); current consumption data show that average daily intake is less than 1% of this and maximum intake less than 10%.\n  \n  Briffa thinks that aspartame metabolism produces methanol toxicity. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, to cause toxicity in humans, 200-500 mg methanol per kg body weight is needed to produce sufficient amounts of its metabolite, formate (federal register 1984). This corresponds to drinking 600-1700 cans of diet soft drink at once, an amount not achieved after a dose of 200 mg aspartame per kg body weight.\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that studies in children show that sugary drinks make them fatter than artificially sweetened drinks, though the evidence in adults is mixed (perhaps because of confounding as people already concerned about weight may tend to drink lower calorie drinks confusing the direction of cause and effect).\n\nSo, overall, there is no convincing reason to suppose that diet drinks sweetened with aspartame are bad for you, especially when compared to the empty calories of sugary drinks which have plenty of bad effects, especially in children. \n\n\n\nUpdate\nThere have been several low quality studies suggesting that aspartame containing drinks don't have the expected effects on obesity (they don't have any calories, so you might think they ought to help compared to sugary drinks). \n\nBut a better quality recent study (link is to pdf of paper) has looked at some of the implications of sugary drinks on long term health and has found a significant association with Type 2 diabetes. \n\nThe summary of the paper claims:\n\n\n  Results In adjusted models, one 336 g (12 oz) daily increment\n  in sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened soft drink\n  consumption was associated with HRs for type 2 diabetes of\n  1.22 (95% CI 1.09, 1.38) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.26, 1.83),\n  respectively. After further adjustment for energy intake and\n  BMI, the association of sugar-sweetened soft drinks with type\n  2 diabetes persisted (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06, 1.32), but the\n  association of artificially sweetened soft drinks became\n  statistically not significant (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95, 1.31).\n  Juice and nectar consumption was not associated with type 2\n  diabetes incidence.\n  \n  Conclusions/interpretation This study corroborates the\n  association between increased incidence of type 2 diabetes\n  and high consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks in\n  European adults.\n\n\nThe lack of significance of the effect in artificially sweetened drinks after adjustment is noteworthy as it suggests that one reason why other studies have not seen the effect on weight is that they did suffer from confounding caused, probably, because the already fat are more likely to take diet drinks.

The claim \"the real ratio of elements would indicate a 50 year old sample\" lies more than 17 standard deviations away from the mean measurement, so it is very unlikely that the sample matched that prediction.\n\nBut here's a problem.  The same flow yielded samples that dated to 1.3 +/- 0.3 MYA, 0.8 +/- 0.2 MYA, and 1.2 +/- 0.2 MYA.  These are also significant numbers.  (One sample also dated to less than 270,000 years ago, which appears to be the minimum measurable value, so is not a significant aberration).\n\nRadiometric dating would predict that, if the assumptions (1) and (2) hold, samples from the same flow would have the same age.  But this is not what is observed, so the theory rejects (1) and/or (2). Therefore, radiometric dating does not predict that the rocks would date accurately.\n\nTherefore this data cannot be used to falsify K-Ar dating, because it does not violate a prediction of radiometric dating.  Instead, the hypothetical contamination scenarios proposed by other answers/comments gain support.\n\nOther methods, such as Isochron dating could potentially be used to show that the data are still consistent with current geological theory.\n\nNote: This answer has been completely rewritten.

So that's 7110 pounds divided by about 16.  That comes out to 433 pounds (196 kg) of corn.  \n\nFrom the Washington Post:  \n\n\n  [...] each pound of corn yields about 1,566 calories.  \n\n\nThat's .45kg and 6.56 MJ.\n\nMultiplying by 1566 and dividing by 365 gives us about 1860 calories (7.8 MJ).  That's sufficient calories per day for a sedentary forty year old woman (as per WebMD).  If our large SUV instead had a thirty gallon (114 litre) tank, that would bring things up to around 2790 calories (11.7 MJ), enough for a moderately active man.  \n\nThis obviously ignores any nutritional deficiencies in corn.  In reality an all corn diet would likely be short on some key nutrients, like protein.  But given that caveat, the comparison is numerically accurate.  \n\nWhy it seems off\n\n\n  Since it definitely costs me more in a year to eat than it would to fill the tank of an SUV, something must be off here. What am I missing?\n\n\nI don't know your actual shopping and dietary habits, but I suspect:  \n\n\nYou don't buy corn in bulk from farmers.  As such, if you bought 433 pounds (196 kg) of corn, you'd pay more than the $21 (US; see the Cornell link for the $1.05 per gallon price).  \nYou have higher standards for your corn than ethanol producers do.  \n\n\nYou want your corn juicy, not dry.  \nYou want all of the husk removed, including the silk strands.\nYou want all of the cob removed.  \n\n\nEthanol producers don't care as much about that stuff.  Corn is preferable, but it's not like they're eating it.  So processing corn for ethanol can take shortcuts that food processors can't.  \nFood corn that is not perfect is removed and not sold as food for people.  It may be fed to animals or turned into ethanol.  \nA lot of the food that you eat is more expensive than corn.  Corn is a staple crop.  It's one of the cheapest foods around.  You'd pay a lot more for a steak made from a cow (probably fed with corn).  But even a decent vegan diet is going to cost more than corn does.  It's not like you eat raw soybeans, corn, wheat, oatmeal, and various vegetables.  You typically add spices, sweeteners, etc. as well as the cost of preparation.  \nOn average, your food probably travels farther than corn does to become ethanol.  This is because the ethanol producers can locate close to the corn to save on shipping costs.  And they don't need their corn fresh.  Some of your food probably comes from the other side of the equator, where it is freshly grown and shipped quickly to you.  \nYou probably spend a significant amount of your food budget on packaging and preservation rather than the contents.  You can get a bushel (25.4 kg) of corn for about $1, but that might buy you a small bag of frozen corn.  \n\n\nTL;DR:  you likely have a more expensive diet than just corn bought in bulk directly from the farmer.  \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/41943#41944", "answerId": "41944"}

He was indeed a very driven individual to reduce cost and make money.  This particular exploit is covered in a book called Corporate Creativity: how innovation and improvement actually happen By Alan G. Robinson, Sam Stern.  The story is detailed on page 107, although there it is claimed it saved $500,000 annually!  Which is significantly over most of the references I found claiming anywhere from $40,000 to $80,000 (more in line with your question).  Maybe that's accounting for inflation?\n\nThis is credible, but I can't find any original documentation yet.  Please stand by.  In the meantime, some additional discussion.  (Still no reply from the museum.  Please stand by.)\n\nI found a site that also ran the calculation and attempted to debunk or confirm this.  This site mentions the more reasonable sum of $40,000 in savings, and says\n\n\n  Probably True- I can't find a single good source on this, but many, many news stories mention this tidbit when discussing Bob Crandall, the former chief of American Airlines who supposedly instituted this change. Granted, being repeated often doesn't make a claim true, but this one seems reasonable enough. consider just how many flights a major airline like American has per year, and how many salads they were serving back when they still served food. Now consider how small $40,000 is in the grand scheme of things for an airline that big. It's only the cost of a single employee, even less if you consider higher paid employees like pilots.\n\n\nThat site also references this article on MSNBC that starts off with\n\n\n  It\u2019s impossible to talk about cutting airline costs without mentioning Bob Crandall, the firebrand former chief of American Airlines. And so, let us revive the olive story. Most notorious among Crandall\u2019s legendary cost-cutting was his idea to remove an olive from each salad served to passengers. A tiny garnish would never be missed, the reasoning went, and savings amounted to at least $40,000 a year. \n\n\nGiven the age of this particular cost saving measure, I think microfiche may be the best way to find out for sure.  I do have a question in to the C.R. Smith Museum (American Airlines history museum), and will report back here if I get a reply.\n\nIn the meantime, let's do a little math.  American Airlines flies over 3400 flights a day. A quick google search for olives yielded prices from $8 to $50 for olives.  Assuming American Airlines gets them in bulk, and at a discount (wholesale), let's say that an olive is only $0.01 (given what I know of olives, seems low).  That means that over 1,241,000 flights in a year, they need to eliminate 4,000,000 olives to save $40,000.  Let's say that less than half the flights (a nice even 500,000) have first class service that serves a meal.  And that there are a total of only 10 first class seats (which on many aircraft is very low).  That gets you almost 5,000,000 olives on salads.  Seems conceivable with those numbers which are probably very conservatives estimates on my part that a saving could be realized (and even a slight change in per olive pricing could have vast changes).  It's not the weight in this case, it's simply a material expense that Bob Crandall figured the passengers wouldn't miss.\n\nAgain, if the American Airlines history museum gets back to me, I will revisit this with a more definitive answer.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5935#5938", "answerId": "5938"}

The term repetitive strain injury includes specific disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, Guyon canal syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, and tendonitis of the wrist or hand. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of history and clinical examination. Large high-quality studies using newer imaging techniques, such as MRI and ultrasonography are few.

Exercise is beneficial for non-specific upper limb disorders.

None the less St. Gregory writing to St. Augustine of England laid down the rule, \"We abstain from flesh meat, and from all things that come from flesh, as milk, cheese, and eggs.\" This decision was afterwards enshrined in the \"Corpus Juris\", and must be regarded as the common law of the Church. Still exceptions were admitted, and dispensations to eat \"lacticinia\" were often granted upon condition of making a contribution to some pious work. These dispensations were known in Germany as Butterbriefe, and several churches are said to have been partly built by the proceeds of such exceptions. One of the steeples of Rouen cathedral was for this reason formerly known as the Butter Tower. This general prohibition of eggs and milk during Lent is perpetuated in the popular custom of blessing or making gifts of eggs at Easter, and in the English usage of eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday.\n\n\nThe practice was tied to the three days Jesus spent in the tomb and/or the 40 days of fasting by Jesus and is a preparation for Easter.

In addition to papers from the\n  marketing and organizational behavior literature, there are a number of findings in empirical labor\n  economics that support the claim. In an early paper that used subjective performance evaluation,\n  Abraham and Medoff (1980) reported that workers\u2019 subjective evaluation scores fell, the longer they\n  were on the job. In Lazear (1992), it was found that the coefficient of job tenure in a wage\n  regression was actually negative.

As explained in the replies, ethylene is lighter than air, so if there is any production there, it can not affect the fruit of the banana as it will rise upwards. But there's another reference here to how ethylene synthesis occurs [2] which negates the possibility of ethylene synthesis in the stem:\n\n\n  Based on our results, ethylene production in ripening banana fruit can\n  be characterized as follows: (a) increase in the abundance of MA-ACS1\n  mRNA in the flesh is the first step of ethylene induction at the onset\n  of the climacteric; (b) the increased content of ACC in the flesh\n  induces a rapid increase of climacteric ethylene whereby ACC oxidase\n  is activated with the enhanced accumulation of MA-ACO1 mRNA once\n  ripening commences;\n\n\nAnd there's an Youtube video that busts this myth\n\nAnd another bust\n\n\n\n[1] Inaba A, Liu X, Yokotani N, Yamane M, Lu WJ, Nakano R, Kubo Y.

If you roll it once and it comes up six, is that because it was loaded, or would it have rolled a six that time even if it wasn't loaded? The most you can say for that one event is that the six was probably due to the loading. Now suppose you roll it 100 times and get 47 sixes. That might happen by chance even with an unloaded dice, but it is so fantastically improbable that you can say the result is \"no question\" due to the loading and ignore the tiny probability that an unloaded dice would have done the same.\n\nIn the case of 2018 weather, I would interpret Prof. Allen's statement in the same light. In his expert opinion the extreme weather events around the world at present would be so unlikely without global warming that the possibility can be discounted. If global warming is affecting weather globally, then of course it is also having an effect in Europe because Europe is part of the globe.\n\nSo yes, there is scientific support for the proposition that global warming is largely responsible for the exceptionally high temperatures seen around the northern hemisphere this summer, including in Europe.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/41959#41964", "answerId": "41964"}

Oxysterols inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity resulting in a decreased cholesterol concentration in the cell membrane, which leads to endothelial membrane injury and probable premature cell death. Exogenous oxidation of cholesterol in human tissues under certain unusual conditions is highly probable. Dietary oxysterols are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and are selectively transported by the athrogenic lipoproteins LDL and VLDL. The oxysterols cholestanetriol and 25-OH cholesterol have been shown to be atherogenic. Oxysterols are commonly found in dried egg products, powdered milk, cheeses and in a variety of high temperature dried animal products.\n\n\n\n\nSearching further, I found:\n\n\nKlaus Zorn-Pauly, Peter Schaffer, Brigitte Pelzmann, Eva Bernhart, Guofeng Wei, Petra Lang, Gerhard Ledinski, Joachim Greilberger, Bernd Koidl, Gunther Jurgens, Oxidized LDL induces ventricular myocyte damage and abnormal\nelectrical activity\u2014role of lipid hydroperoxides Cardiovasc Res (2005) 66 (1): 74-83.\ndoi: 10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.12.009\n\n\nThey showed that guinea-pig cells, in a dish, dosed with Ox-LDL:\n\n\n  induced cell damage and irregular electrical activity in ventricular myocytes.

The\n  oxysterols found in these products are the same as those in processed\n  eggs. However, fresh milk contains 0 or only trace amounts of\n  cholesterol oxides, which means that processing (e.g high temperature)\n  is the main source of oxysterols (Angulo et al., 1997). Other\n  milk-derived products such as cheeses, yogurt, and evaporated milk,\n  contain very low amounts of cholesterol oxides. The oxysterol content\n  of milk powder is in the range 1.0-2.5 ug/g. Dehydrated cheese has\n  8-15 ug/g; skimmed milk powder, 0.01-0.1 ug/g; and whole milk powder,\n  0.2-0.8 ug/g (Paniangvait et al., 1995).

We\u2019ve all heard how it\u2019s important\n  to keep our cholesterol levels down, and that our \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol\n  number, or HDL, should be normal or above normal, for better health.\n  But it plays a more important role than that. Oxysterols that are\n  produced from our bodies using cholesterol are meant to be broken down\n  by the liver. However, people with a number of diseases like Hardened\n  Arteries and Multiple Sclerosis have been found to have extremely high\n  level of Oxysterols in their bodies. This has been found in some\n  patients with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, as well.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  The reason science is taking a hard look at the link between\n  Oxysterols and Alzheimer\u2019s is that our central nervous system contains\n  the highest concentration of cholesterol in our bodies. Our brains\n  need cholesterol to function properly. Many people believe that\n  cholesterol is simply something to be watched in the diet to avoid\n  heart disease and arteriosclerosis, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s vital\n  for life.\n  \n  [...] \n  \n  While cholesterol itself doesn\u2019t actually cross the blood-brain\n  barrier, some of its by-products do. So any cholesterol-related\n  processes that take place will affect the brain and nervous system\n  heavily, most likely more than any other bodily system.  \n  \n  [...]\n  \n  Only about a dozen of the known Oxysterols have been studied, and much\n  more research is needed for the many that we haven\u2019t explored.\n  Scientists do say that since the Oxysterols are created when our\n  bodies utilize cholesterol, and that a great deal of the cholesterol\n  we have is produced by our bodies and not thanks to diet, a change in\n  diet won\u2019t affect the levels that might be linked to Alzheimer\u2019s and\n  other diseases.\n\n\nFinally, this article  looks at the types of Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL)and shows that Oxidized Low Density Lipoproteins (ox-LDL) causes cell damage. \n\n\n\nBriefly: Oxysterols are produced in our body already. Dry Milk contains oxysterols in a low amount, but enough to increase the natural levels. Research on diseased bodies shown that they also contain high oxysterol levels. This shows us oxysterols might be playing a bigger role than we know and that Dry Milk ma be harmful for long term usage, but the research is not yet clear.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9029#9104", "answerId": "9104"}

This is the conclusion supported by all credible recent scientific articles. This is also the Australian Government's official position.\n\nNote: All bolded text is added emphasis not present in the original source. All cited scientific articles are peer-reviewed.\n\nGiven that the question was asked over 4 years ago, new developments have surfaced.\n\nIn 2019, Dehhaghi et al. wrote (in an open-access peer-reviewed article):\n\n\n  Importantly, there is no convincing evidence for the presence of locally acquired Lyme disease in Australia.\n  \n  The presence of Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis, LB) or Lyme-like disease in Australia is highly controversial. The Australian Government Chief Medical Officer convened a Clinical Advisory Committee on Lyme Disease in 2013 to advise on aspects of Lyme disease in Australia.\n  \n  Hence, there is no evidence for transmission of B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex with Australian ticks. Whilst patients in Australia with Lyme-like disease may occasionally have positive Lyme serology, finding the causative agent using PCR or direct culture is regarded as mandatory for confirmation of local acquisition of infection.\n\n\nThe Australian Government report is available here and is extremely indecisive.\n\n\n  At the same time, the department is aware that Australian ticks are important vectors of human disease, e.g., rickettsial infections, Q fever and the newly described mammalian meat allergy.\n  \n  The department will continue to encourage, identify and make known relevant Australian research on tick-borne disease.\n\n\nThe Australian Government petition statement states\n\n\n  Classical Lyme disease is an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans if bitten by a tick carrying Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In Australia, this organism has yet to be identified in Australian ticks or any another vector that could transmit disease to humans. It is for this reason that the Australian Government does not support the diagnosis of locally acquired Lyme disease in Australia.\n\n\nThus, the Australian Government is saying that Lyme disease is not endemic to Australia. This concurs with the New South Wales fact sheet. The Australian Parliament conducted a short-term inquiry into Lyme disease in Australia. Submissions (some are accessible) are available here. The final report, which \"will be presented here as soon as it is available.\" is still not available, despite a reporting date of 20 June 2016. The interim report released on 4 May 2016 literally contains no conclusions and \"recommends that the Community Affairs References Committee continue its inquiry into this matter in the 45th Parliament.\" Do note that the inquiry has most likely lapsed: \"Inquiries that were not completed have lapsed and submissions cannot be received.\"\n\nIn 2016, Chalada et al. wrote (in an open-access peer-reviewed article):\n\n\n  In the last twenty-five years there have been over 500 reports of an Australian Lyme-like syndrome in the scientific literature. However, the diagnoses of Lyme Borreliosis made in these cases have been primarily by clinical presentation and laboratory results of tentative reliability and the true cause of these illnesses remains unknown. A number of animals have been introduced to Australia that may act as B. burgdorferi s. l. reservoirs in Lyme-endemic countries, and there are some Australian Ixodes spp. and Haemaphysalis spp. ticks whose geographical distribution matches that of the Australian Lyme-like cases. Four published studies have searched for Borreliain Australian ticks, with contradicting results. The cause of the potential Lyme-like disease in Australia remains to be defined.\n  \n  [Summaries of the four studies]\n  \n  2.6.1. Wills and Barry 1991\n  \n  At least four of the spirochaetes isolated shared antigenic epitopes with B. burgdorferias demonstrated by ELISA, immunofluorescence and western blotting, suggestive of Borrelia species. However, details of the laboratory methods are not published and the organisms recovered were not made available for confirmation by another laboratory, rendering the experiment unable to be replicated.\n  \n  2.6.2. Russell et al. 1994\n  \n  The study found \u201cno definitive evidence for the existence in Australia of B. burgdorferi the causative agent of true Lyme Borreliosis, or for anyother tick-borne spirochaete that may be responsible for a local syndrome being reported as Lyme disease\u201d. The authors observed Wills' and Barry's cultured Borrelia and found them to be identical to their own SLOs, concluding that Wills' and Barry's cultured SLOs were also contaminant flagella aggregates. Russell et al. also had the advantages of Borrelia genus-specific PCR and a much larger sample size over Wills' and Barry's study. The conclusion of Russell et al's study\u2013that no spirochaetes were able to be identified through culture or molecular methods in Australian ticks\u2013therefore seems more plausible than the conclusions of Wills and Barry.\n  \n  2.6.3. Gofton et al. 2015a\n  \n  This work provides further evidence that the cause of the Lyme-like illness in Australia may not be a member of the B. burgdorferi s. l. complex. The finding of a novel relapsing fever Borreliain an Australian monotreme does provide evidence for the presence of Borreliae in Australia, but it is not known if this organism can infect humans, and should it do so, it is likely that it would present as a relapsing fever illness rather than with Lyme-like symptoms. These factors limit the likelihood that this novel Borrelia species is the cause of the Lyme-like illnesses seen in Australia.\n  \n  2.6.4. Gofton et al. 2015b\n  \n  A Borrelia genus specific flaB nested PCR was also performed on all ticks recovered. None of the ticks concerned yielded any Borrelia sequences or PCR products[76].\n\n\nWhat this means (from the above excerpts and my own reading of the provided sources):\n\nThe first study (pay-walled) found epitopes of the Lyme disease-causing species in (4 out of 177) Australian ticks. Thus, this is evidence of Lyme disease endemic in Australia. However, Chalada et al. note no follow-up was conducted and the experiment is \"unable to be replicated\" due to lack of details of experimental methods.\n\nThe second study, with a larger sample size of \"approximately 12,000 ticks\" found \"no definitive evidence\" of the Lyme disease-causing species. The authors used genus-specific PCR and Chalada et al. seem to place more weight on this study.\n\nThe third study found a new species in the genus of the Lyme disease-causing species in Australian ticks. Notably, Grofton writes (in a different article) \"The zoonotic potential and pathogenic consequences of this novel Borrelia sp. are unknown at the current time.\" Chalada et al. support that this novel species doesn't cause Lyme disease (though this isn't explicitly stated in the original study).\n\nThe fourth study (of 460 ticks) found no evidence of the Lyme disease-causing species despite a genus specific PCR.\n\nNon-tick studies have also been conducted. In 2017, Irwin et al. studied 555 dogs and found no evidence of the Lyme disease-causing species.\n\n\n  To date, there has been no convincing evidence for locally-acquired Lyme borreliosis on the Australian continent and there is currently a national debate concerning the nature and distributions of zoonotic tick-transmitted infectious disease in Australia. In studies conducted in Europe and the United States, dogs have been used as sentinels for tick-associated illness in people since they readily contact ticks that may harbour zoonotic pathogens. Applying this principle, we used a combination of serological assays to test dogs living in tick \u2018hot spots\u2019 and exposed to the Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus, for evidence of exposure to B. burgdorferi (s.l.) antigens and other vector-borne pathogens.\n  \n  Except for a single dog presumed to have been exposed to Anaplasma platys, infection with Anaplasma spp. B. burgdorferi (s.l.), Ehrlichia spp., and Dirofilaria immitis, was not detected in the cohort of Australian dogs evaluated in this study. These results provide further evidence that Lyme borreliosis does not exist in Australia but that cross-reacting antibodies (false positive results) are common and may be caused by the transmission of other tick-associated organisms.\n\n\nCollignon et al. wrote a narrative review (review article) about the subject:\n\n\n  There is no convincing evidence that classic Lyme disease occurs in Australia, nor is there evidence that the causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, is found in Australian animals or ticks.\n\n\nIt is a nice, short read, containing a section titled \"Background to the belief that Lyme disease exists in Australia.\" and references to the Senate inquiry.\n\nIn 2018, Brown wrote:\n\n\n  Patients diagnosed with Lyme disease in Australia display a symptomology similar to \u2018medically unexplained physical symptoms\u2019 syndromes, experience social and financial harms, and are at risk of nosocomial harms. Negative medical interactions and the media may contribute to patients seeking alternative and potentially non\u2010evidence\u2010based diagnoses and treatments.\n\n\nBeaman also touches on a similar concept in a 2016 article:\n\n\n  Despite this, patients who have not left Australia pay many thousands of dollars for non-specialist consultations and testing at overseas laboratories. Unproven long-term therapy with multiple antibiotics has resulted in serious complications, including allergies, line sepsis, pancreatitis and pseudomembranous colitis. Studies have shown that LD vectors are not found in Australia, and Lyme Borrelia has not been found in Australian vectors, animals or patients with autochthonous illnesses.\n\n\nTo conclude:\n\n\n  Is there an existing risk of contracting locally-acquired Lyme disease within Australia?\n\n\nFrom recent studies: no, Lyme disease is not endemic within Australia. However, there is a conflicting 1991 study that found evidence of the Lyme disease-causing species (within 4 out of 177) native Australian ticks.\n\nNote: The only recent peer-reviewed article I found that mentions Lyme disease exists in Australia is this one. I would like to point out this journal is less credible than the ones I cited because it is the kind that is open access and charges the authors a fee (\"550 CHF (Swiss Francs)\") to publish. Additionally, I can't find many references to this journal online.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/26426#43873", "answerId": "43873"}
{"question": "Do drug addicts stop maturing when they become addicted?", "questionId": "1738", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1738", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "I'm not positive on the definitive answer -- this may be very difficult to extract a causal relationship from in terms of the available literature.\n\nFrom what I have found, many suggest that those who use drugs in the first place already have some difficulties/pre-dispositions to such usage. For example:\n\n\nFergusson/Horwood, \"Early onset cannabis use and psychosocial adjustment in young adults,\" 1997 (LINK):\n\n\n\n  First, those electing to use cannabis were a high risk population characterized by social disadvantage, childhood adversity, early onset behavioural difficulties and adverse peer affiliations. Secondly, early onset cannabis use was associated with subsequent affiliations with delinquent and substance using peers, moving away from home and dropping out of education with these factors in turn, being associated with increased psychosocial risk.\n\n\n\nNewcomb/Bentler, \"Impact of adolescent drug use and social support on problems of young adults,\" 1988 (LINK):\n\n\n\n  We obtained data from 654 teenagers when they were in early and late adolescence and used it to evaluate resultant problems reported by this same group of youngsters when they were young adults. General, or polydrug, use increased drug and alcohol, health, and family problems... Alcohol use, which was not reflected in General Drug Use, had no specific negative effects, but it reduced loneliness in romantic relationships, self-derogation, and family problems.\n  \n  General social support during adolescence provided a significant amelioration of all seven young-adult problem areas.\n\n\n\nNewcomb/Bentler, \"Consequences of adolescent drug use: Impact on the lives of young adults (Book),\" 1988 (LINK and Table of Contents):\n\n\n\n  Using its unique data base of 654 young adults who have been followed since early adolescences, the book assesses the effects of adolescent drug use on young adult family formation and stability, deviant behavior, sexual behavior and involvement, educational pursuits, livelihood pursuits, mental health, and social integration.\n\n\n\nTrinidad/Johnson, \"The association between emotional intelligence and early adolescent tobacco and alcohol use,\" 2000 (LINK):\n\n\n\n  A study was conducted to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and adolescent tobacco and alcohol use (TAU). Subjects were 205 multi-ethnic adolescents (52% male) from middle schools in southern California (mean AGE=12.63 years), 153 from a public school and 52 from a parochial school. An abbreviated version of the Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale... was used to assess the EI of the students. EI was negatively correlated with a general, overall measure of tobacco and alcohol use, and with individual tobacco and alcohol scales and items.\n\n\nWhat does all of this amount to? I'm not quite sure, but I'd at least put forward the following as potential hypotheses:\n\n\nAt least two of the studies have shown that those who began to use already had some family, psychological issues, and lack of social support. This might be a case of hindsight bias, in which development issues that were unnoticed prior to drug usage are now explained away as \"common sense\" once drug usage escalates.\nThe study showing that social support alleviated some of the negatives typically brought about by drug use may shed some light on the source of issues/immaturity. Perhaps one's peer group and their influences matter more than consumed substances.\nThe work by Newcomb/Bentler, particularly the book, might be fantastic follow-up material. They appear to have gauged the effects of younger-aged drug use on later life endeavors. While not particularly evaluating emotional growth during usage, this book might shed light on whether post-usage individuals displayed significant differences from peers that had not previously used.\n\n\nI did find a study indicating that drug use may affect age-critical neurological development:\n\n\nCrews, et al., \"Adolescent cortical development: A critical period of vulnerability for addiction,\" 2006 (See LINK):\n\n\n\n  Frontal cortical development is later in adolescence and likely contributes to refinement of reasoning, goal and priority setting, impulse control and evaluating long and short term rewards. Adolescent humans have high levels of binge drinking and experimentation with other drugs. This review presents findings supporting adolescence as a critical period of cortical development important for establishing life long adult characteristics that are disrupted by alcohol and drug use.\n\n\nSo, these folks at least make the case that drug use may negatively affect a critical period in brain development and lead to negative outcomes. Toward the bottom of that article, they put forward this graphic:\n\n\n\nYou can read the report at your leisure, but this model appears to suggest that heavy consumption disrupts development such that one stabilizes at a lower level than one who never experienced disrupted growth. Thus, this might support the idea that one stagnates for some time during addiction, or at least slows.\n\nI'll conclude there -- I wish I had been able to find something more definitive. I may revise the answer if I get time to look into this from another angle which occurred to me: one could examine what contributes to increased maturity and see if drugs are used as an alternative or \"escape\" from such mechanisms, events. For example, perhaps the death of a loved one, dealt with among friends and families and long hard times of thought would bring about some quotient of maturity, while simply using drugs to \"escape\" would not be as beneficial. This is speculation at present, but it's another route to trying to answer this.\n\nLastly, it may be that addicts simply display less maturity and thus simply appear to have stunted their growth. From WIKI:\n\n\n  Addiction can also be viewed as a continued involvement with a substance or activity despite the negative consequences associated with it.\n\n\nThus, in the end, it may be tautological that an addicted person appears to not be maturing, since maturity is generally seen as shaping behaviors toward positive goals, avoiding detrimental consequences, appropriate action, etc. Addiction, by the definition, implies an immaturity of choice.\n\nHopefully I haven't clouded the waters too much.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1738#4764", "answerId": "4764"}

From the abstract:\n\n\n  High-pressure boiling, low-pressure boiling (conventional), steaming and microwaving were the four domestic cooking processes used in this work. ... The results showed large differences among the four treatments in their influence on flavonoid and hydroxycinnamoyl derivative contents in broccoli. Clear disadvantages were detected when broccoli was microwaved, namely high losses of flavonoids (97%), sinapic acid derivatives (74%) and caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives (87%). Conventional boiling led to a significant loss of flavonoids (66%) from fresh raw broccoli, while high-pressure boiling caused considerable leaching (47%) of caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives into the cooking water. On the other hand, steaming had minimal effects, in terms of loss, on both flavonoid and hydroxycinnamoyl derivative contents. Therefore we can conclude that a greater quantity of phenolic compounds will be provided by consumption of steamed broccoli as compared with broccoli prepared by other cooking processes.\n\n\nNow whether the nutrients studied here constitute \"important vitamins\" is an exercise left to the reader.\n\nAccording to another study from the Journal of Food Science (paywall), summarized here:\n\n\n  Results showed that, depending on the vegetable, cooking on a flat metal surface with no oil (griddling) and microwave cooking maintained the highest antioxidant levels.\n\n\nNote that these studies are not limited to the \"washing away\" or leeching effect on nutrients, but also consider the destruction of nutrients during cooking.  The latter obviously does not directly answer your claim, but is probably equally relevant to anyone interested in food nutrition.\n\nIn summary, the preferred cooking method likely depends on your vegetable, but boiling is known to leech nutrients (sometimes this is even beneficial, as in the case of Swiss chard, where boiling allegedly reduces the acidic content [source]).

The physical body type an individual possesses has an \n  influence on the behaviour or personality of that individual, as posited by Sheldon\u2019s constitutional theory. This \n  was confirmed, even when applied in the African society specifically in The Gambia, by this study. [emphasis mine]\n\n\nHere's a 2006 paper making similar claims:\n\n\n  Investigated whether measures of personality considered compositely and individually differ significantly among groups differentiated according to self-perceived somatotype (PSS). The Bodv Cathexis Scale, Eysenck Personality Inventory, and Tennessee Self-Concept Scale were employed to assess personality in 285 college males, and the indices of somatotype were measured using the Perceived Somatotype Scale. MANOVA revealed significant differences in global personality among the groups. Univariate analyses indicated that the PSS groups differed significantly in self-concept, extraversion, neuroticism, and body cathexis, while the PSI groups differed significantly in extraversion. Apparently, the male personality is partly a function of the body build perceived as self, the image viewed as ideal, and whether a discrepancy exists between the figures perceived as self and ideal.\n\n\nAnd here's a third, from 2010:\n\n\n  After examining the relativity between personal measurement categories of the subjects and character type through the MBTI, Extraversion(E) type showed inverse correlation in stature, height, biacromial breadth, and subcutaneous fat thickness of posterior iliospinale. Contrary to the E type, the Introversion(I) type showed positive correlation. Sensing(S) type showed inverse correlation only in biacromial breadth, Intuition(N) type showed positive correlation in most categories including height, width and the subcutaneous fat thickness. Thinking(T) type showed positive correlation in bust point-bust point, chest depth and hip width. Feeling(F) type, on the other hand, showed inverse correlation. The Judging(J) type showed inverse correlation in stature, height, length and the parts of chest. In contrast, Perceiving(P) type showed positive correlation in other categories including biacromial breadth, same as the J type.\n\n\nA Google scholar search for \"Somatotype personality\", limited to publications since 2010, produces almost 500 results, which suggests this is still an active area of research.\n\nAdditional caveat: I am not qualified to assess whether the research present is correcting for discipline appropriate factors, and thus whether their findings are valid. However, taken at face value, it looks like there is some relationship between somatotype and personality, and all of these papers are referencing the theory. Some of them are using more detailed measurements however.  \n\nEDIT: Some additional information in response to one of the comments: Yes, one's somatotype can change over time, for at least some groups (I speculate: for anyone).

Although the use of artificial colouring in food manufacture might seem superfluous, the same cannot be said for sodium benzoate, which has an important preservative function. The implications of these results for the regulation of food additive use could be substantial.\n\n\nSo, what exactly did they do?\n\nThey recruited groups of 3 and 8/9 years old children from Southampton, UK. In particular they had 137 3 years old and 130 8/9 years old completing the study (the paper explains the recruitment in more detail). They then tested the effect (vs. placebo) of 2 mixes, called A and B, containing different amount of various food colouring (sunset yellow, carmoisine, tartrazine, ponceau 4R, quinoline yellow, allura red AC, plus sodium benzoate. 8/9-year-old children had 1.25 times bigger doses.\n\nNow, I don't have kids myself, but reading this sentence I would say this is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more than I would give my kid to eat... anyways\n\n\n  Doses for mixes A and B for 3-year-old children were roughly the same as the amount of food colouring in two 56-g bags of sweets. For 8/9-year-old children, the dose for mix A was equal to about two bags of sweets a day and for mix B about four bags of sweets a day.\n\n\nThe protocol they followed\n\n\n  After a week on their typical diet (week 0: baseline diet), the artificial colours to be used in the challenges and sodium benzoate were withdrawn from their diet for 6 weeks. Over this period when challenge with active or placebo drinks were given, additive withdrawal continued (week 1: withdrawal period but receiving placebo; weeks 2, 4, and 6: challenge with randomisation to two active periods and one placebo period; weeks 3 and 5: washout continuing on placebo). During this period, 3-year-old children received the challenge and washout-placebo drinks on a weekly basis and consumed mixed fruit juices (placebo or active) at home (300 mL/day for 3-year-old children, 625 mL/day for 8/9-year-old children), provided in identical sealed bottles. At the beginning of the study, children were assigned by the study administrator by a random-number generator to receive one of six possible sequences of placebo, active mix A, or active mix B challenges across weeks 2, 4, and 6.\n\n\nAll the various mixes were tested so that they could not be discriminated by look and/or taste.\n\nBehaviour was then assessed with different methods (essentially questionnaire given to the parents, assessment of behaviour in classrooms and, for the older children, a visual test). I am not an expert on these matters, so I cannot really comment on these tests, but I assume they're quite standard ways to measure hyperactivity (and I'm sure Lancet recruits competent reviewers...)\n\nI'll skip you all the stats, but the conclusion was that \n\n\n  Our complete case data has indicated that the effect sizes, in terms of the difference between the GHA under active mix and placebo challenges, were very similar for mix B in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children. For mix A, the effect for 3-year-old children was greater than for 8/9-year-old children. The effects for mix B were not significant for 3-year-old children because there was greater variability in the response to the active challenges than placebo in this age group. Thus, we recorded substantial individual differences in the response of children to the additives. For both age groups, no significant effect of social and demographic factors was seen on the initial level of GHA or in the moderation of the challenge effects.\n\n\nThey continue saying that:\n\n\n  The specific deleterious compounds in the mix cannot be determined for the present study and need to be examined in subsequent studies. The effect of artificial colours needs to be differentiated from the effects of preservatives in a 2\u00d72 design. Further investigation would also need to establish whether the age-related difference seen in the present study can be replicated\u2014ie, the effects of mix A being greater for 3-year-old children than for 8/9-year-old children. We examined the effects of additives on changes in behaviour during an extended period in a community-based, double-blinded, placebo-controlled food challenge. A weakness in this approach is the lack of control over when the challenges are ingested in relation to the timing of measures of hyperactivity. This study design also needs extensive resources to obtain multisource and multicontext measures of hyperactivity. We have completed a pilot study showing that changes in hyperactivity in response to food additives can be produced within about 1 h. Therefore, future studies could use more feasible acute double-blinded challenges undertaken in more controlled settings.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a big amount of literature on the matter.\n\nI will only link to a couple of reviews, you can go through their references if you want more information.\n\nDo artificial food colors promote hyperactivity in children with hyperactive syndromes? A meta-analysis of double-blind placebo-controlled trials.\n\n\n  Despite indications of publication bias and other limitations, this study is consistent with accumulating evidence that neurobehavioral toxicity may characterize a variety of widely distributed chemicals. Improvement in the identification of responders is required before strong clinical recommendations can be made.\n\n\nDietary sensitivities and ADHD symptoms: thirty-five years of research.\n\n\n  Artificial food colors (AFCs) have not been established as the main cause of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but accumulated evidence suggests that a subgroup shows significant symptom improvement when consuming an AFC-free diet and reacts with ADHD-type symptoms on challenge with AFCs. Of children with suspected sensitivities, 65% to 89% reacted when challenged with at least 100 mg of AFC. Oligoantigenic diet studies suggested that some children in addition to being sensitive to AFCs are also sensitive to common nonsalicylate foods (milk, chocolate, soy, eggs, wheat, corn, legumes) as well as salicylate-containing grapes, tomatoes, and orange. Some studies found \"cosensitivity\" to be more the rule than the exception. Recently, 2 large studies demonstrated behavioral sensitivity to AFCs and benzoate in children both with and without ADHD. A trial elimination diet is appropriate for children who have not responded satisfactorily to conventional treatment or whose parents wish to pursue a dietary investigation.\n\n\nSo... essentially there is not a crystal clear answer, but there may be effects of specific food colouring, possibly depending on the sensitivity and the age of the children.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6485#6490", "answerId": "6490"}

In a survey conducted by Mintel, 64 percent of households with children present owned pets whereas 52 percent of those without children owned pets (Mintel, p. 67).\n\n\nThe Mintel paper referenced is titled, \"The U.S. Pet  Food &amp; Supplies Market,\" but I can't find a link to an abstract or something similar.\n\n\nWestgarth et al., \"Factors associated with dog ownership and contact with dogs in a UK,\" 2007 (SOURCE):\n\n\n\n  This study supports the suggestion that dogs are more common in families who have older children (6-19 years), as has been generally observed in other countries.\n\n\n\nThe tables HERE, based on data from the \"U.S. Pet Ownership &amp; Demographics Sourcebook (2007 Edition)\n\" (LINK) seems to indicate that families with children own more pets than children-less families (potentially).\n\n\nFor example (values in percents):\n\n                            Dog     Cat     Bird    Horse\nFamily size: 1 One person   13.2    16.8    12.7    12.1      \nTwo persons                 31.0    32.6    27.9    29.1    \nThree persons               21.4    20.6    20.4    22.0    \nFour or more persons        34.5    29.9    38.9    36.7\n\n\nThus, we see a see higher rates of ownership for households with more individuals living in them. I said \"potentially\" above, as we don't know the ages of these increased individuals. I will say, there's an obvious dip for three person households, so perhaps two parents with one child are seen with pets less often, and thus this hypothesis was created? Pure speculation, but I did see the big dip between two and four person households.\n\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics features some helpful data on this as well (LINK):\n\n\nABS data on ownership stats http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/2f762f95845417aeca25706c00834efa/5ef8016f420622a3ca2570ec00753524/Body/0.2AFA!OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif\n\nSo, we see that families with all ranges of kids own pets all at rates above 50%.\n\nThe same site also has a similar breakdown to the table above (values in percents):\n\n                                Dogs   Cats   Birds  Fish  All\nMarried couple with dependants  49.0   32.9   21.0   16.0  74.0\nOther married couple            37.3   25.7   16.3   5.4   59.4\nLone parent with dependants     41.1   29.5   11.4   7.5   62.2\nLone person aged less than 35   18.9   7.9    5.6    2.8   30.2\nLone person aged 60 or more     15.8   15.4   8.9    0.4   32.3\n\n\nSo, we see the highest rates of ownership for married couples with dependents and single parents with dependents (at least for all pets except birds). The next highest rates of ownership are from married couples with no dependents (I'm assuming that's what \"other married couples\" means).\n\n\nI saved this source for last, as I couldn't track the figures cited to something more reliable...

I'm thinking it might be the \"U.S. Pet Ownership &amp; Demographics Sourcebook\" listed above, as this appears in the list of references.

The circumstantial evidence for this is good but leads to expectations that indicates a limited applicability and a temporary, small effect. This is not a Nuremberg funnel.\n\nThe font was developed by people at a university at RMIT\u2019s Behavioural Business Lab.\n\nAnd the psychological base theory for this is called Levels-of-processing effect: the more the brain has to work, the slower you read and the more parts of the brain get activated facilitating chunking and clustering of memories. As such the theoretical foundation is rather solid, for a psychological theory.\n\nRelevant papers pertaining to this theory and its application are:\n\nDiemand-Yauman, C., Oppenheimer, D. M., &amp; Vaughan, E. B. (2011): \"Fortune favors the bold (and the Italicized): Effects of disfluency on educational outcomes\", Cognition, 118(1), 111\u2013115. (PDF)\n\nYue, C. L., Castel, A.

(PDF)\n\nJust one anecdote: I was to told to read my textbooks upside down to exploit that effect. Or with a mirror. I did that. I was slowed down by that.\n\nIt is claimed that\n\n\n  Sans Forgetica was tested against 400 Australian university students in laboratory and online experiments as well, so they\u2019ve released it with some pretty solid evidence that it works. news.com.au\n\n\nWhile the designers claim it did improve recall in testing the font, they themselves say it should still not be adopted universally:\n\n\n  About 400 university students have been involved in a study that found a small increase in the amount participants remembered \u2013 57% of text written in Sans Forgetica compared with 50% in a plain Arial. [...]\n  The font was designed with year 12 students cramming for exams in mind but could also be used to help people studying foreign languages and elderly people grappling with memory loss.\n  \n  Blijlevens is keen to test the font in other contexts such as proofreading.\n  \n  Banham, who has created about 20 fonts, said the typeface would be best used for short texts.\n  \n  \u201cGod no, you wouldn\u2019t want novels printed in it, it would probably induce a headache,\u201d he said.\n  \n  The font took about six months to develop and there were three different versions tested.\n   \u2013\u2013 Guardian 2018: \"Font of all knowledge? Researchers develop typeface they say can boost memory\"\n\n\nUnfortunately, Wikipedia already summarises the situation:\n\n\n  Sans Forgetica was spawned from a study of 96 Australian university students. An online experiment including 303 students followed. As of May 2019, no peer-reviewed research or data has been released that supports the assertions of the Sans Forgetica team.\n\n\nThe big problem in the room here is that it is still a standardised font and as such the small effect it did display in testing by the designers will diminish as people habituate to the initial difficulty. \n\nBlackletter typefaces slow down most modern readers, but just like 100 years ago, this will speed up to normal levels once the new, formerly  \"difficult\" shapes get so familiar that they can again be recognised by their 'word outlines' and skimming the text becomes possible again.\n\nReading upside down has no longer a discernible effect.\n\nVisual Form Perception in Deficient and Normal Readers as a Function of Age and Orthographic-Linguistic Familiarity\n\n\n  Yet a typeface that relies on novelty to jolt the brain into absorption and retention also runs a fairly significant risk: What happens when the reader gets used to Sans Forgetica? The Mere Exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon whereby people express a preference for things simply because they are familiar. As readers become accustomed to Sans Forgetica\u2019s initially odd appearance, grow more comfortable with it, and start reading it faster, will the retention rate of information decline? Will their brains simply adapt to the difficulties posed by the typeface in such a way as to eliminate the benefits?\n  \n  Further long-term studies are the only way to determine whether this is likely. For now, the early results are encouraging, based as they are on solid principles of cognitive neuroscience. But while an increase of 7% in memory retention is measurable and real, it also doesn\u2019t leave much room for decline within those results over time; in other words, if readers start to lose even 1% of retention every few months as they become accustomed to Sans Forgetica, soon the advantage is lost.\n  \n  There are physical changes in the brain related to long term memory\u2014a quantifiable difference between learning something quickly forgotten (like a phone number) and learning something that endures (like multiplication tables). A study investigating whether these brain changes actually take place after exposure to Sans Forgetica could shed additional light on the typeface\u2019s effectiveness.\n   \u2013\u2013 Angela Riechers: \"Can \u201cBad\u201d Type Design Help Readers Absorb and Remember Information?\", December 10th, 2018.\n\n\nAnd for the general theory from psychology, being as a field subject to replication crisis already, it sheds further doubt on the results for Sans Forgetica to read:\n\n\n  Prior research suggests that reducing font clarity can cause people to consider printed information more carefully. The most famous demonstration showed that participants were more likely to solve counterintuitive math problems when they were printed in hard-to-read font. However, after pooling data from that experiment with 16 attempts to replicate it, we find no effect on solution rates. We examine potential moderating variables, including cognitive ability, presentation format, and experimental setting, but we find no evidence of a disfluent font benefit under any conditions. More generally, though disfluent fonts slightly increase response times, we find little evidence that they activate analytic reasoning.\n   \u2013\u2013 A Meyer et al.: \"Disfluent fonts don't help people solve math problems\", J Exp Psychol Gen. 2015 Apr;144(2):e16-30. doi: 10.1037/xge0000049.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44229#44231", "answerId": "44231"}

At least it is not as much supported as the claim suggests and not in this automated equation it suggests. But this is still quite intriguing.\n\nThere is a link between both vitamins. The pro position in favour of the claim simply states:\n\n\n  [Vitamin D] Signs and symptoms beyond deficiency, however, remain to be elucidated. Based on clinical and observational data, the plasma level of 25(OH)D may serve as a 'marker' to detect or define a subclinical deficiency. Levels below 50 nmol/l might be insufficient to maintain the non-bone-related activities of vitamin D. Finally, it has to be considered that all of the nonbone activities of vitamin D are in concert with vitamin A (9-cis retinoic acid). Studies combining both vitamins in sufficient amounts (cod liver oil) demonstrated a beneficial effect on the prevention of respiratory tract infections. Consequently, it should be strongly recommended to increase the intake of vitamin D and to ensure a daily intake of vitamin A as counseled.\n   H. K. Biesalski: \"Vitamin D recommendations: beyond deficiency.\" Ann Nutr Metab. 2011;59(1):10-6. DOI:10.1159/000332066 \n\n\nBut that is far from the consensus:\n\n\n  Although activated vitamin D and vitamin A signal through common cofactors, they compete for each other\u2019s function. Retinoic acid antagonizes the action of vitamin D and its active metabolite. In humans, even the vitamin A in a single serving of liver impairs vitamin D\u2019s rapid intestinal calcium response. In a dietary intake study, Oh et al found that a high retinol intake completely thwarted vitamin D\u2019s otherwise protective effect on distal colorectal adenoma, and they found a clear relationship between vitamin D and vitamin A intakes, as the women in the highest quintile of vitamin D intake ingested around 10,000 IU/d of retinol.\n  Furthermore, the consumption of preformed retinol \u2014 even in amounts consumed by many Americans in both multivitamins and cod liver oil \u2014 may cause bone toxicity in individuals with inadequate vitamin D status. Women in the highest quintile of total vitamin A intake have a 1.5-times elevated risk of hip fracture. Indeed, a recent Cochrane Review found that vitamin A supplements increased the total mortality rate by 16%, perhaps through antagonism of vitamin D. Another recent Cochrane Review concluded that although vitamin A significantly reduced the incidence of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children with low intake of retinol, as occurs in the Third World, it appears to increase the risk and/or worsen the clinical course in children in developed countries.\n   VitaminDWiki: Vitamin D needs some vitamin A, but not too much\n\n\nOne of the aspects mentioned above turns the claim on its feet: with low vitamin D you have to decrease your vitamin A intake to prevent known harmful effects. If that is one of the base lines where the claim comes from? Then this is logically unsound, the reverse is not true.\n\nMore on the metabolism of the vitamins A and D are discussed here:     \n\n\n  J. Rodrigo Mora: \"Vitamin effects on the immune system: vitamins A and D take centre stage\" Nat Rev Immunol. 2008 Sep; 8(9): 685\u2013698.\n  doi:  10.1038/nri2378\n\n\nDiscussion:\nSomehwat undecided. In its essence this claim seems almost to be true. Some vitamin A is needed for proper vitamin D metabolism and functioning.\nBut some vitamin A is needed for prevention of death after all, or less dramatic: for a functioning body, since it is quite rightly classified as a \"vitamin\". How much is this \"some\" and does a higher intake of vitamin D increase the need for retinol? That is currently unknown. What is known is that high amounts of vitamin A (retinol) are toxic and high amounts of vitamin D  are toxic. Cod liver oil for example seems to contain so much of both substances that only very small amounts of the whole complex seem to have beneficial effects, if at all.\n\nA problem is in the phrasing of the claim: \"Supplemented vitamin D\". Supplemented vitamin D is almost never the active vitamin but nearly always the precursor D3 (cholecalciferol), with a much higher safety level since it is converted by the body to the active form of vitamin D as needed.\nJohn N Hathcock &amp; Andrew Shao &amp; Reinhold Vieth &amp; Robert Heaney: \"Risk assessment for vitamin D\" The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Volume 85, Issue 1, 1 January 2007, Pages 6\u201318, https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/85.1.6 \n\nThat supplemented vitamin A (retinol) is usually going from \"hm, good idea\" to \"desastrous effects\" really fast should be considered as well. Cod liver oil counts as a supplement here.    \n\n\n  J N Hathcock: \"Evaluation of vitamin A toxicity\" The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Volume 52, Issue 2, 1 August 1990, Pages 183\u2013202, https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/52.2.183\n\n\nReading in the claim to broadly supplement vitamins and not forgetting about cod liver oil seems not the brightest idea. Wikipedia puts it quite simple:\n\n\n  Though similar in fatty acid composition to other fish oils, cod liver oil has higher concentrations of vitamins A and D. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a tablespoon (13.6 grams or 14.8 mL) of cod liver oil contains 4,080 \u03bcg of retinol (vitamin A) and 34 \u03bcg (1.360 IU) of vitamin D. The Dietary Reference Intake of vitamin A is 900 \u03bcg per day for adult men and 700 \u03bcg per day for women, while that for vitamin D is 15 \u03bcg per day. The Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) are 3000 \u03bcg/day and 100 \u03bcg/day, respectively. People consuming cod liver oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids should pay attention to how much vitamin A and vitamin D this adds to their diet.\n  A tablespoon (13.6 g) of cod liver oil contains 136% of the UL for preformed vitamin A (retinol). Vitamin A accumulates in the liver, and can reach harmful levels sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A. Pregnant women may want to consider consulting a doctor when taking cod liver oil because of the high amount of retinol.\n  Fatty acid oxidation and environmental toxins content are reduced when purification processes are applied to produce refined fish oil products.\n  Wikipedia: Cod liver oil\n\n\nTo repeat: just one table spoon of cod liver oil already exceeds the tolerable upper intake limit for vitamin A! Doing that for an intermediate time span is just looking for trouble.\n\nAnd the role of both vitamins in bone health alone is fantastically complicated:\n\n\n  Supplementation of the diet with vitamins is a common occurrence and there is debate over whether increased vitamin A intake might promote skeletal fragility. Some studies have suggested that increased vitamin A intake may decrease BMD and promote hip fracture; however, other studies have not shown increased bone loss or increased fracture risk, and in some instances, protection from bone loss by vitamin A has been suggested. Vitamin D plays a major role in calcium absorption and mineral homeostasis. Vitamin D deficiency is common and some studies have suggested that he risk of osteoporosis and fracture may increase when increased vitamin A intake occurs in individuals with low vitamin D levels. It is possible that an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture might exist for increased vitamin A intake and/or increased intake in the face of low vitamin D, but it appears that additional in vivo animal studies and studies in humans to confirm or dispel these possibilities will be necessary before clearer estimates of risk emerge.       \n  \n  Increased osteoclastic resorption of periosteal bone is a well documented in vitro consequence of excess vitamin A. Calvarial bone is considered to be a good model of periosteal resorption of cortical bone and it has been established that ATRA is a good in vitro stimulator of RANKL, osteoclastogenesis, and resorption in cultured calvarial bones. In contrast, there is also ample evidence that ATRA is a potent in vitro inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis in cell culture systems employing progenitors from either mouse bone marrow or spleen, or human peripheral blood. Periosteal resorption of cortical bone has also been firmly established as an in vivo consequence of excess vitamin A in experimental animals, as well as in humans. Furthermore, available evidence suggests that excess vitamin A also decreases endosteal blood flow, reduces endosteal osteoclast formation, and promotes endosteal mineralization.    \n  \n  Effects of vitamin A on cancellous bone resorption are less clear. Of the three animal studies investigating cancellous bone, one has shown a decrease in trabecular osteoclasts with no change in trabecular bone mass. These data appear to be in agreement with in vitro investigations indicating inhibition of osteoclast progenitors from bone marrow; however, the two other studies have reported decreases in trabecular bone mass and, in one of these investigations, no change in trabecular osteoclasts. Thus, it appears additional in vivo animal studies will be necessary before these different observations can be clarified.\n  Most of the studies on effects of vitamin A on osteoblast differentiation and formation indicate that vitamin A promotes osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Interestingly, injury induced heterotopic bone formation can be inhibited by RAR  signaling by retinoids.     \n  \n  In postmenopausal osteoporosis, the prevailing idea has been that loss of trabecular bone was the main cause of increased fracture, but evidence is now accumulating which suggests that loss of cortical bone might be the major determinant of fracture risk in these patients. Cortical bone thinning occurring in humans as a consequence of increased vitamin A intake would also cause bone fragility, but unlike osteoporosis in the postmenopausal female, where cancellous bone loss is significant, cancellous bone loss may not play as prominent a role in vitamin A excess. In the past, DXA has been employed to measure BMD and has proven to be valuable clinically, especially in the post menopausal female, but DXA does not distinguish between cortical and trabecular bone. To what extent past use of DXA for BMD measurements using criteria normally employed for conditions like post-menopausal osteoporosis may have lead to differing outcomes in some of the studies evaluating vitamin A intake, BMD, and fracture risk is unclear, but use of more specific tools to distinguish between trabecular and cortical bone appear to be essential.       \n  \n  Other than for the suggestion of low levels of vitamin D, it is not known presently if there might be other specific conditions or dietary and environmental differences that might enhance bone loss in the presence of increased concentrations of vitamin A. \n  \n  Valuable insight for preventing future harmful effects of vitamin A on bone might be gained by additional correlative studies of vitamin A intake. Animal studies using state of the art techniques to access site specific effects of vitamin A on bone resorption and formation, BMD, and bone fragility also seem clearly warranted, as do studies in mice with cell specific deletions of different RARs and RXRs. Genetic studies evaluating the relationships of RAR and RXR genes to bone mass and fragility fracture in the human should additionally be pursued. Moreover, prospective studies in humans using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of specific effects in cortical and trabecular bone appear to be essential if we are to gain a better understanding of the risk that increased vitamin A intake might pose to skeletal health.\n  H.

{"question": "Does GPS use General Relativity?", "questionId": "20230", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20230", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "Yes, GPS requires both general and special relativity to work\n\n[Note this is simplified account based on this and this (MS word download)]\n\nWe can understand why by looking at how GPS actually determines where you are. The system relies on a number of satellites transmitting signals and your GPS device receiving those signals (see wikipedia). There are about 32 GPS satellites and each transmits a signal that contains the exact time based on very accurate atomic clocks on the satellite and position information about where the satellite is. A typical GPS receiver can \"see\" a handful of satellites from any given position on the earth's surface. Crudely, the position of the receiver is calculated by noting how long the signal takes to arrive from each satellite, using this to calculate the distance to the satellite and then, by trilateration (the 3D equivalent of triangulation), deriving the receiver's position from the distances from several satellites whose positions are known.\n\nCivilian GPS is typically quoted as having an accuracy of about +/- 15m though there are ways to do better. Military GPS can go below +/- 1m precision. Since the speed of light (the speed of the radio signals from the satellites) is about 300 million m/s this means we need to be able to account for time in accurate units of a handful of nano seconds to get that degree of precision for distance.\n\nThis is where relativity comes in. Clocks are affected by both gravity and motion. High speeds make clocks run slower according to special relativity and higher gravity also slows them according to general relativity. Since GPS satellites travel at about 14,000km/hr their clocks will be slow relative to the earth's surface by about 7 microseconds (7,000 nano seconds) per day. Because the earth's surface has gravity about 4 times higher than a GPS satellite the satellite clocks run about 45 microseconds faster than one on the ground. This gives a net difference of about 38 microseconds relative to the surface per day. If we ignored relativity and failed to correct for this, GPS positions would be out by about a dozen kilometres per day (those microseconds trump the required accuracy of nanoseconds by factors of thousands).\n\nTo summarise the issue. We need to keep accurate account of time for GPS to work. But GPS clocks are affected by relativistic effects that alter their clocks relative to the earth's surface. We can retain accurate times if we adjust for the known differences and so we can retain an ability to accurately find the position of a GPS receiver.\n\nSo relativity, both special and general, is required or the system would be useless.\n\nPhilosophical note\n\nThe comments here have suggested that there is some obfuscation and confusion on the conclusion here. \n\nIt is true, as some have pointed out, that absolute proof is not possible in science (at least if you take a Popperian view of verification). Facts can show a theory is wrong, but they can't prove it is correct. While true this isn't a strong objection to the answer here. Perhaps it would be clearer if we said \"provides extremely strong evidence in favour of\" rather than \"proves\" but in practice the difference is small.\n\nIn the case of GPS we have a scientific theory (or two related theories) that predicted precise effects more than 50 years before the GPS system was deployed. That is pretty much the strongest sort of scientific verification that is possible. Arguing that it isn't \"proof\" in a mathematical sense is merely nit-picking.\n\nAnd arguing that the relativistic corrections would be irrelevant in a Newtonian universe is just a ridiculous distraction based on an irrelevant philosophical though experiment. The question is about this universe and this universe is accurately modeled by relativity. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20230#20236", "answerId": "20236"}

The risk seems to depend on the cell phone and pacemaker involved.  Apparently there's no conflict in some cases, while there can be in other cases.  The American Heart Association (ACA) does warn that some newer cell phones can make pacemakers less reliable.\n\nGiven these risks, it makes sense that Japanese trains - which are notorious for having people cramped together - would warn about cell phones, as there's a lot of potential for someone with a pacemaker to end up smooshed against someone with a cell phone at minimal distance.\n\nSources\n\nFrom \"Interference with Pacemakers and Other Medical Devices\", FDA:\n\n\n  Potential interference\n  \n  Radiofrequency energy (RF) from cell phones can interact with some electronic devices.

They also warn that newer cellphones might \"make pacemakers less reliable\".\n\nFrom \"The effects of mobile phones on pacemaker function\" (2004):\n\n\n  4. Discussion\n  \n  This is a clinical study trying to identify the effects of electromagnetic field generated by mobile phones that are currently used worldwide on transvenous permanent pacemaker function. In our study, we demonstrated the presence of such an effect without any doubt and found the total adverse effect rate as 5.5% in 679 pacemaker patients.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  5. Conclusion\n  \n  Under certain conditions, mobile phones can cause temporary dysfunctions on pacemaker functions. It is highly probable that such adverse effects would be seen at a distance of 10 cm. Having a unipolar lead polarity increases the risk of being affected. The risk of being adversely affected is not different for single-chamber and dual-chamber pacemakers. Older generation pacemakers are under greater risk when compared to new generations. However, there is no need to panic. This effect is completely reversible and is not life-threatening except for the patients who are completely pacemaker-dependent. The temporary changes in the functions of the pacemakers are observed as ventricular triggering in dual-chamber pacemakers, and the entire dual-chamber pacemakers that are manufactured today have the mode-switch feature. Single-chamber pacemakers usually switch to asynchronous mode (VOO). The important issue is that there is a possibility of total pacemaker inhibition in patients who are completely pacemaker-dependent. To this end, when pacemakers are being implanted, the lead polarity should be bipolar if the patient does not have a rhythm of his own, and they should be informed about how to use the mobile phones safely.\n\n\nFrom \"RF Safety FAQ\", FCC:\n\n\n  CAN IMPLANTED ELECTRONIC CARDIAC PACEMAKERS BE AFFECTED BY NEARBY RF DEVICES SUCH AS MICROWAVE OVENS OR CELLULAR TELEPHONES?\n  \n  Over the past several years there has been concern that signals from some RF devices could interfere with the operation of implanted electronic pacemakers and other medical devices.  Because pacemakers are electronic devices, they could be susceptible to electromagnetic signals that could cause them to malfunction. [...]\n  \n  Some studies have shown that mobile phones can interfere with implanted cardiac pacemakers if a phone is used in close proximity (within about 8 inches) of a pacemaker.  It appears that such interference is limited to older pacemakers, which may no longer be in use.  Nonetheless, to avoid this potential problem, pacemaker patients can avoid placing a phone in a pocket close to the location of their pacemaker or otherwise place the phone near the pacemaker location during phone use.  Patients with pacemakers should consult with their physician or the FDA if they believe that they may have a problem related to RF interference.\n\n\nComments\n\nCell phones raise their output power when they're struggling to get signal, such as if they're in a train that's going through a tunnel or competing with other nearby cell phones.  This raises the risk for higher exposure under such conditions.\n\nIt's worth noting that this problem is similar to why cell phones are discouraged on airplanes, leading to an \"Airplane Mode\" to be put into most modern devices.  Activating this mode causes the cell phone's antennas to turn off.  Assuming that all antennas are turned off, or at least the main ones, then I'd expect this to significantly reduce the risk to nearby pacemakers.\n\nOne complicating factor is that technology's rapidly changing, including the types, powers, and frequency of signals being used.  This makes it hard to say with certainty that new devices, or devices that'll be out in a few years, won't pose new threats.\n\nInteresting factoids from the cited references\n\n\nCell phones don't usually appear to cause major adverse reactions, despite having been proven to cause them in some cases.\nSome cell phone technologies are safer than others.  3G and BlueTooth technologies were noted as relatively safe.\nNewer pacemakers are generally believed to be safer with respect to these issues, though guidelines still urge caution.\nSignal power is a big deal.\n\n\nThe signal needs to be powerful enough to cause an effect.\nSignal power has three major factors:\n\n\nHow strong the cell phone's max output is.\n\n\nThe AHA notes \"Currently, phones available in the United States (less than 3 watts) don't appear to damage pulse generators or affect how the pacemaker works\".\n\nWhat portion of its max the cell phone is working at.\n\n\nUsually cell phones increase power to improve signal.\nIf the cell phone's not actively in use, it's probably lower.\n\nHow far the pacemaker is from the cell phone.\n\n\nElectromagnetic radiation drops off with the inverse square law.  This means that having the cell phone 2 inches away drops the radiation by a factor of 4 compared to having it 1 inch away.\nThe FDA recommends: \"Hold the phone to the ear opposite the side of the body where the pacemaker is implanted to add some extra distance between the pacemaker and the phone\".\n\n\n\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/38528#38531", "answerId": "38531"}

Source: The Lazarus Phenomenon, Explained\n\n\n\nThe explanation for this phenomenon is that in some cases, there are effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on venous return and cardiac output which might cause delayed return of spontaneous circulation.\n\n\n\n  The exact mechanism of delayed ROSC is unclear and it is possible that more than one mechanism is involved. Dynamic hyperinflation of the lung causing increased positive end expiratory pressure (PPEP) is one of the proposed mechanisms, which has some supporting evidence in patients with obstructive airways disease. Death should not be certified in any patient immediately after stopping CPR, and one should wait at least 10 minutes, if not longer, to verify and confirm death beyond doubt. This is in line with what was said by W H Sweet in 1978: \u2018the time honoured criteria of the stoppage of the heart beat and circulation are indicative of death only when they persist long enough for the brain to die.

{"question": "Do extreme homeopathic dilutions still retain quantities of the starting materials?", "questionId": "27876", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27876", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "\n  This Indian Institute of Technology Bombay press release quotes some research papers\n\n\nThis isn't really true. It is just one research paper, and one comment on said research paper.  Also, it merely describes the paper, without quoting it.  \n\nIn any case, a major finding of the first paper is that there are discrete metal particles in the mixture.  In other words, it is not a true solution.  \n\nThat there are discrete metal particles in the mixture, permits mechanisms whereby the manipulative steps one executes in diluting do not result in a quantitative dilution.  \n\nFor example, if you throw 100 liters of ping-pong balls into a 1,000,000 liter swimming pool filled with water, stir the swimming pool, and skim a sample of material from the top layer of the pool, the volume-fraction of ping pong balls in the sample will differ from the ratio 1:10,000 expected on a basis of the ping-pong balls being randomly distributed in the water, because ping-pong balls float.\n\nThis is basically what the first two articles mentioned in the OP are finding.  The metal particles are concentrated at the surface due to bubbles.  If only material from a top layer is used for each round of dilution, the dilution is not quantitative.  The final concentration is greater than would be predicted on the basis of what would happen to a true homogeneous solution.\n\nFlotation is a long-known technique for concentrating metals such as gold at the surface of a mixture using bubbles.  See Froth Flotation: A Century of Innovation.\n\nThe research cited in the OP is not something that can be generalized to all homeopathic preparations.  It only applies to certain homeopathic solutions prepared in certain ways.  For example, if material is not taken from near the top of the container, but instead in the central portion of the container, then the final preparation would be at least as dilute as expected.  \n\nThe title question \"Do extreme homeopathic dilutions still retain quantities of the starting materials?\" is phrased so as to necessarily be false.  If it retains a significant amount of starting material, by definition it is not extremely dilute.  The articles in the OP simply show that dilution techniques that work for true solutions, such as salt water, do not always work quantitatively for mixtures with solid particles.  \n\nThe above findings are further discussed in Adverse effects and homeopathy: may remedies yet contain noxious or toxic molecules? British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology  2014 Jul; 78(1):184-5.  The research cited in the OP, together with research such as Effect of alcohol-water exchange and surface scanning on nanobubbles and the attraction between hydrophobic surfaces. J Colloid Interface Science  2008; 325: 267\u201374 is being accepted as correct and showing the possible risks of metals or other starting materials being unexpectedly present due to failed dilution attempts.  \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27876#27895", "answerId": "27895"}

{"question": "Are one-hit knockouts possible?", "questionId": "3451", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3451", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "In movies, knocking someone unconscious can look like this:\n\n\n\nIt can be a PG-13 way to take care of a bad guy, who wakes up sometime later with only a headache.\n(However, more realistic depictions can be found, usually in war movies.)\n\nIn real life, it looks more like this:\n\n\n\nWhat isn't shown is that in reality a person knocked unconscious is usually knocked out only for a few seconds, minutes at most.  \n\nIf a person is knocked out for longer than that, this may indicate severe brain damage, which could lead to loss of function, life-long debilitation, coma, and death.  Essentially, a blow hard enough to knock a person unconscious is classified as a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).  Since most guards,henchmen,etc.in movies are knocked out for extended periods of time, it quite possible that they may suffer severe brain damage. \n\nAlso the force (Scientific American has one pro boxer's punch at 400kg)required to knock someone out might also break the skull or kill the person. Even wikipedia's article on boxing states that there is no clear line drawn between the force needed to knock someone out and the force needed to kill that person. \n\nSo, knocking someone unconscious by hitting them in the head is clearly not as practical or consequence-free as tv and movies might lead one to believe.\n\nThe most common causes of being knocked unconscious are related to either falls or vehicle crashes.  However, direct trauma to the head is another cause, the CDC lists assault as accounting for 10% of reported cases.  (Fact: Chuck Norris is responsible for 9.7%)\n\nWhat is TBI?\n\n\n  Traumatic brain injury is the most\n  common cause of death and disability\n  in young people. There is much hope\n  for improvement in early care and\n  functional outcome by use of\n  scientific evidence-based guidelines.\n  Traumatic brain injury is graded as\n  mild, moderate, or severe on the basis\n  of the level of consciousness or\n  Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score after\n  resuscitation (panel). Mild traumatic\n  brain injury (GCS 13\u201315) is in most\n  cases a concussion and there is full\n  neurological recovery, although many\n  of these patients have short-term\n  memory and concentration\n  difficulties.1 In moderate traumatic\n  brain injury (GCS 9\u201313) the patient is\n  lethargic or stuporous, and in severe\n  injury (GCS 3\u20138) the patient is\n  comatose, unable to open his or her\n  eyes or follow commands. Patients with\n  severe traumatic brain injury\n  (comatose) have a significant risk of\n  hypotension, hypoxaemia, and brain\n  swelling. If these sequelae are not\n  prevented or treated properly, they\n  can exacerbate brain damage and\n  increase the risk of death. source\n\n\nIn reality, TBI consists of more than just the initial impact.\n\nStep 1: Impact\n\nThe main thing to keep in mind is:\n\n\n  Although TBI is a problem of major\n  medical and socioeconomic\n  significance, its pathogenesis is\n  incompletely understood, and it is\n  often difficult to reconstruct the\n  events leading to the primary and\n  secondary lesions of varying severity\n  and regional distribution that\n  constitute TBI source\n\n\nThis means that while there are some general aspects and theories we can apply broadly to patients with TBI, it is by no means a cut-and-dry phenomenon, and individual cases show great variation.\n\n\n\nAt the time of the initial impact, the brain is injured in two places, the place of the impact and the side opposite the place of impact. This happens because the brain is surrounded by fluid and can be moved if if enough force is applied.\n\nIn movies, it is this intial impact which renders the victim unconscious, however in reality, this is not always the case.\n\nStep 2: Secondary Injuries:\n\nIn reality, the person may not be rendered unconscious by the primary injury.  However, they may become unconscious later due to the secondary injuries. Secondary injuries are typically caused by bleeding or swelling within the skull which compresses the brain.\n\n\n  The principal mechanisms of TBI are\n  classified as (a) focal brain damage\n  due to contact injury types resulting\n  in contusion, laceration, and\n  intracranial haemorrhage or (b)\n  diffuse brain damage due to\n  acceleration/deceleration injury types\n  resulting in diffuse axonal injury or\n  brain swelling.2404649 Outcome from\n  head injury is determined by two\n  substantially different\n  mechanisms/stages: (a) the primary\n  insult (primary damage, mechanical\n  damage) occurring at the moment of\n  impact. In treatment terms, this type\n  of injury is exclusively sensitive to\n  preventive but not therapeutic\n  measures. (b) The secondary insult\n  (secondary damage, delayed\n  non-mechanical damage) represents\n  consecutive pathological processes\n  initiated at the moment of injury with\n  delayed clinical presentation.\n  Cerebral ischaemia and intracranial\n  hypertension refer to secondary\n  insults and, in treatment terms, these\n  types of injury are sensitive to\n  therapeutic interventions. source\n\n\nSome common occurrences in head injuries:\n\nConcussions\n\nThe word \"concussion\" has many different meanings to patients, families, and physicians. One definition:a condition in which there is a traumatically induced alteration in mental status, with or without an associated loss of consciousness (LOC). \n\nA broader definition for concussion: A traumatically induced physiologic disruption in brain function that is manifest by LOC, memory loss, alteration of mental state or personality, or focal neurologic deficits. \n\nWhile there are many individual variations, concussions usually result in relatively temporary impairment of neurologic function\n\nAgain, things are not so clear cut when dealing with concussions, and post-concussion syndromes:\n\n\n  Post concussive syndrome (PCS), a\n  sequela of minor head injury (MHI),\n  has been a much-debated topic. Muddled\n  by conflicting findings regarding\n  symptom duration, an absence of\n  objective neurologic findings,\n  inconsistencies in presentation,\n  poorly understood etiology, and\n  significant methodologic problems in\n  the literature, postconcussive\n  syndrome (PCS) remains controversial.\n  Depending on the definition and the\n  population examined, 29-90% of\n  patients experience postconcussive\n  symptoms shortly after the traumatic\n  insult.source(medscape link)\n\n\n(One symptom of concussions is nausea/vomiting which you don't see in movies too often.)\n\nIntracranial Hematomas\n\n\n  A hematoma is a swelling of blood\n  confined to an organ or tissue, caused\n  by hemorrhaging from a break in one or\n  more blood vessels. As a cerebral\n  hematoma grows, it damages or kills\n  the surrounding brain tissue by\n  compressing it and restricting its\n  blood supply, producing the symptoms\n  of stroke. The hematoma eventually\n  stops growing as the blood clots, the\n  pressure cuts off its blood supply, or\n  both. source\n\n\nThey are classified from small to massive depending on diameter and volume. Effects vary according to size and location.\n\n\n\nWhite arrows are pointing to the hematoma.\n\nIntracranial Hemmorhages\n\n\n\nBlack arrows point to subdural bleeding\nWhite arrow points to the midline shift of the brain.\nThe build-up of blood in the skull is putting extensive pressure on the brain.  Enough bleeding will essentially \"crush\" the brain, causing the brainstem to herniate.\n\nDiffuse Axonal Injury\nBasically this is extensive damage to the white matter.\n\n\n\n\n  Diffuse axonal injury is one of the\n  most important types of brain damage\n  that can occur as a result of\n  non-missile head injury. Increasing\n  experience with fatal non-missile head\n  injury in man has allowed the\n  identification of three grades of\n  diffuse axonal injury. In grade 1\n  there is histological evidence of\n  axonal injury in the white matter of\n  the cerebral hemispheres, the corpus\n  callosum, the brain stem and, less\n  commonly, the cerebellum; in grade 2\n  there is also a focal lesion in the\n  corpus callosum; and in grade 3 there\n  is in addition a focal lesion in the\n  dorsolateral quadrant or quadrants of\n  the rostral brain stem. source\n\n\nDiffuse axonal injuries can occur at the time of the initial impact, or develop during the minutes or hours after the injury.\n\nLength of time unconscious correllates to severity of the brain injury\n\n\nPost-traumatic amnesia(PTA) is defined as the time from the initial injury until the patient can demonstrate conscious memory of what is going on around him/her.\n\n\n  The duration of PTA was the best\n  predictor of outcome selected in this\n  model for all endpoints and elements\n  of the physical examination provided\n  additional predictive value. source (medscape link)\n\n\nAge is also a factor in predicting outcome...\n\n\n  Duration of PTA appears to be a useful\n  variable in predicting specific\n  functional outcome in the TBI\n  population receiving inpatient\n  rehabilitation services. The use of\n  age as a factor in addition to\n  duration of PTA enhances the\n  prediction of functional outcome.\n  source(medscape link)\n\n\nConcluding (finally)\n\nMost movies simply cherry-pick the most convenient aspects of head injury to advance their plot.  Either the person will only be unconscious for a very short time and wake up relatively fine, or the person will be unconscious for an extended time, but likely suffer severe consequences.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3451#3526", "answerId": "3526"}

He also focuses on IQ because it is one of the most contentious but also best-researched of such topics. He's not too flexible on ethics, so you might want to look to other authors for less retricted viewpoints on the ethical aspects. I think he does a great job pointing out methodological concerns and their implications.\n\nIs it settled?\n\nIf by settled, you mean settled either way, I'd rather not reply, because usually you can always find some hypothetical counter-argument when you come up with something.\nI think it's instructive, however, because it shows that the variation in nurture and nature matters.\nFor example PKU used to entail a dramatic reduction in IQ and it is definitely due to the genotype \u2013 however, now that the process is understood and the afflicted maintain a special diet, there is \"nurture\" variance \u2013 some people know about that diet and maintain it more or less well. Before that diet was known, the environmental variance was low. This would also affect the hereditity quotient of PKU.\n\nIf by settled, you mean do academics agree, I'd say, yes. Those who consider both biological as well as environmental factors (for example psychologists like Rutter, biologists, some sociologists like Udry) in their analyses usually find some agreement: environmental as well as biological factors and their interactions matter and you can also arrive at conclusions which factors explain how much variance (in, say, IQ). However, it is complicated and in the case of IQ for example, the degree of social variance (for example mandatory public school vs. only the privileged have any education) and biological variance (a small town, where everyone is related) play a role.\n\nOf course there are contentious debates even among those academics who agree that both factors and their interaction play a role. For example, the Flynn effect (IQ test scores rose in the developed countries in the last 100 years) has been the matter of contentious debate (in short the hugeness of the rise isn't easily reconciled with the huge portion of variance explained by biological factors), but I think few who are actually involved in that debate would say \"maybe we'll know in 1000 years\". Instead they peddle their pet theories from heterosis to prenatal environmental influence etc., but that's just science in progress.\n\nIn the answer you linked to, I suspect appealing to lack of clarity was an attempt to stir some dust up, so as not to concede being wrong.\n\nI think the contentiousness of these questions stems from the fact that to the uninformed some of the conclusions seemingly conflict with dearly-held convictions like equality of chances. I think truth should not be judged by what \"ought to be\", but for any individual it's hard to keep them apart in every line of thought. But among serious academics these convictions probably only make some round their estimates of heredity down or up, not reject one source of variance out of hand (well you can probably find someone who still does, but I doubt they could answer a few simple questions about their premises correctly).\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3194#3722", "answerId": "3722"}

The 2% come from the IPCC report which states:\n\n\n  Global economic impacts from climate change are difficult to estimate.\n  Economic impact estimates completed over the past 20 years vary in their coverage of subsets of economic sectors and depend on a large number of assumptions, many of which are disputable, and many estimates do not account for catastrophic changes, tipping points, and many other factors.\n  \n  With these recognized limitations, the incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of ~2\u00b0C are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income (\u00b11 standard deviation around the mean) (medium evidence, medium agreement). Losses are more likely than not to be greater, rather than smaller, than this range (limited evidence, high agreement).\n  \n  Additionally, there are large differences between and within countries.\n  Losses accelerate with greater warming (limited evidence, high agreement),\n  but few quantitative estimates have been completed\n  for additional warming around 3\u00b0C or above.\n  Estimates of the incremental economic impact of emitting carbon dioxide lie between a few dollars and several hundreds of dollars per tonne of carbon 60 (robust evidence, medium agreement). Estimates vary strongly with the assumed damage function and discount rate.\n\n\nThis indeed says that the estimated global economic loss of income is between 0.2 and 2.0% for an increase in temperature of 2\u00b0C. Which is (from the same report) in the high-emission scenario going to be around 2050.\nIt also says however that this is difficult to estimate and that for higher temperature increases, there are few estimates. \n\nNow where do the 11% that policies will cost come from? It's from another IPCC report:\n\n\n  Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately, there is a single global carbon price, and all key technologies are available, have been used as a cost\u2010effective benchmark for estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs (Table SPM.2, green segments). Under these assumptions, mitigation scenarios that reach atmospheric concentrations of about 450ppm CO2 eq by 2100 entail losses in global consumption\u2014not including benefits of reduced climate change as well as co\u2010benefits and adverse side\u2010effects of mitigation \u2014 of 1% to 4% (median:1.7%) in 2030, 2% to 6% (median:3.4%) in 2050, and 3% to 11% (median:4.8%) in 2100 relative to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than 900% over the century.\n  These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 (median:0.06) percentage points over the century relative to annualized consumption growth\n  in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per year. \n\n\nSo the report concludes on a reduction of 3% to 11% in consumption in 2100 or more clearly on a annual consumption growth that it is slightly reduced (0.04 to 0.14 (median:0.06) percentage points).\n\nNow, of course comparing a reduction of the consumption rate to a loss of income is comparing apples and oranges. The conclusion that the costs of climate policies are five time highers than the benefits cannot be drawn from those numbers.\n\nOther than that there are other aspects why the reasoning is false. For instance it does not take into account the costs of not taking action now will have on the time after 2080, where if no action is taken, the temperature will continue to grow (see the IPCC report). \n\nFurther information can be found on this article on the Skeptical Science blog with additional sources.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20344#20345", "answerId": "20345"}
{"question": "Is a vegetarian (vegan) diet more healthy?", "questionId": "1790", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1790", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "From your comments, I am guessing that you will be a hardened skeptic. You've come to the right place.\n\nLet me address a couple of points. First, I agree with you that correlation is not causation. But my guess is that you are not looking for causation (for example, the biochemical processes that causes a higher incidence of heart disease in meat eaters). After all, who knows what causes heart disease? There are experts who might guess, but I don't think any researcher has come up with a single, definitive cause.\n\n(EDIT start: heightening the contrast between correlation and causation.) Let's turn our attention to the causation / correlation contrast for a different health-related matter: Smoking (perhaps unhealthy) verses Non-Smoking (perhaps healthier).\n\nHere is a proposition, turned into a parallel of the vegan/healthier argument. Does non-smoking cause not-lung-cancer? OR is non-smoking correlated to not-lung-cancer? (I apologize for the Aristotelian flip here, but just think \"absence of lung cancer\" as a parallel to \"healthier.)\n\nTo ask for causation is to ask too much. Some non-smokers get lung cancer. See http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/5/875.short. Therefore, there is no causal link between not-smoking and absence of lung cancer.\n\nIn contrast, science has asserted that smoking is correlated with an increased incidence of lung cancer. Now that is a different question. Even a skeptic would say there is a correlation. Non-smoking correlates to lower lung-cancer incidence. \n\nIt would be scientific, but unethical, to cage humans and force one group to smoke and not have another group smoke. It would be scientific, but unethical, to cage humans and force-feed one group meat and force-feed another group vegetables. (EDIT ends.)\n\nA scientifically accepted way to test humans is to do an epidemiological study. One type of epidemiological study would be to monitor many people over a long period of time.\n\nIt turns out that protein intake has been studied for both monozygotic (identical) twins and vegetarianism for an epidemiological survey of a homogeneous group.\n\nThe first study is called \u201cDietary protein and blood pressure in monozygotic twins\u201d by\nRichard J. Havlik M.D, et. al, published in Preventive Medicine (Vol 19, Issue 1, pp. 31-35). It shows that \n\n\n  Using differences in monozygotic\n  twins, a direct association of dietary\n  protein intake and diastolic blood\n  pressure was identified and persisted\n  after adjustment for known covariates\n  of blood pressure. Adjusting for known\n  covariates and holding total calories\n  constant, a 9-g difference in daily\n  protein intake was directly associated\n  with a 1 mm Hg difference in diastolic\n  blood pressure.\n\n\nSimply put, what they found was that after adjusting for differences other than genetics (because monozygotic twins have the identical genetic makeup), more protein correlates to higher blood pressure. \n\nAs you have noted, vegetarian diets tend to be poorer in protein. You might object that this study shows a relationship between protein and BP, not meat and BP. All that an inveterate skeptic would conclude is that this study shows a link between vegetarian diets and lower BP, but perhaps not a strong link. On to the second study.\n\nThe epidemiological study may be found in Am J Clin Nutr September 1988 vol. 48 no. 3 739-748, which you may read in full, online. It compares a large number (n=27,529) of Seventh-Day Adventists. The Adventists are prohibited from using tobacco, alcohol, and pork. They are discouraged from consuming other meats, fish and eggs. Because eating a vegetarian diet is optional, this made for an ideal epidemiological study in that the meat-eaters and the vegetarians have similar life styles and all live in the same US state (California).\n\nBefore I discuss the study\u2019s conclusions, let me observe that it addresses almost all of your objections. It is a large study. It draws scientific conclusions, based on well known statistical methods. It minimizes lifestyle differences and geographic differences of the participants. It was published in a peer-reviewed journal. (The reviewers are, in a sense, skeptics-for-hire. Their job is to ferret out any design flaws, incorrect inferences, and confounding factors.)\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n\n  Within this population, meat\n  consumption was positively associated\n  with mortality because of all causes\n  of death combined (in males), coronary\n  heart disease (in males and females),\n  and diabetes (in males). Egg\n  consumption was positively associated\n  with mortality because of all causes\n  combined (in females), and cancers of\n  the colon (in males and females\n  combined) and ovary. Milk consumption\n  was positively associated only with\n  prostate cancer mortality, and cheese\n  consumption did not have a clear\n  relationship with any cause of death.\n\n\n\u201cPositively associated with\u201d means more x correlates with more y. (x = meat, eggs, milk; y=death for all causes, death by colon cancer, death by heart disease). If you delve into the article, you will see that the tests are very statistically significant. For the case of all-cause mortality in males, the significance (p &lt; .0001) means that only in 1 case out of 1000 would you find that the results were due to chance.\n\nThis significance is much higher than that you would see for drug trials, for instance. \n\nThe author, Dr. Snowdon, has done his job of showing correlation. (Remember, the standard is to show correlation to a given significance, not to show causation.) He even has a section about the limitations of the study. (There were three: 1) Gathering a lot of data means a simpler survey; 2) Dietary habits may have changed since the study began; 3) He did not study what substituted for meat (e.g., fruits and vegetables substituted for meat may be the cause for lower mortality).)\n\nHis only grant was from the US National Cancer Institute, so the paper was not sponsored by PETA or the Dairy industry, for example. \n\nIf you compare the scientific studies of smoking correlating with lung cancer (for example, http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/54/22/5801.short), you will see that for some studies, the statistical significance levels are still very high (P = 0.001), but not as high as the Adventist study. The relationship between eating meat and these major diseases is more strongly linked.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1790#2058", "answerId": "2058"}

Red releases\n  endorphins into your system that stimulate the appetite.\n\n\nMost of them give reference to this article (who apparently is offline now):\n\nhttp://www.colorschemer.com/blog/2007/07/17/why-food-companies-use-red-colors/\n\nFortunately, I could get a version from Wayback Machine, you can see it here.\n\nThe article is small, unreferenced and full of logical falacies. \n\nFor example, they say that:\n\n\n  What do Safeway, Walgreens, and Costco have in common? The obvious\n  answer is that they are all large operated American supermarkets. But\n  do you think it\u2019s any coincidence that these three grocery stores \u2013\n  along with others like Winn-Dixie, Wawa, Giant, and Supervalu \u2013 all\n  use red in their logo?\n\n\nInteresting, they mention a list of junk-food restaurants (or supermarkets) who list red in their logo as a proof that they Red makes you hungry.\n\nThey also forget to mention restaurants that don't use red in their logos, like:\n\n\nSubway\nTaco Bell \nDunkin Donuts\nApplebee's\nOn the border\nShake snack\nJust salad\nWhite Castle\nPanera\nStarbucks\nLittle Caesars\nCarvel \nThe list goes on...\n\n\nIf you google any name from the list, you would see that the logo doesn't have a red colour.\n\nWith the help of Rob Marsh, I found an interesting academic article called \"Impact of color on marketing\". They found out that:\n\n\n  red light stimulates feeding, as in humans, most likely by affecting\n  central control centers, but the extra feeding is not converted into\n  growth.\n\n\nThis study proves that red stimulates hunger in fish, and also claim that it stimulates hunger in humans by referencing to:\n\n\n  Satyendra Singh, (2006) \"Impact of color on marketing\", Management\n  Decision, Vol. 44 Iss: 6, pp.783 - 789\n\n\nIf you dig in Singh's article:\n\n\n  The red color stimulates appetite because of its effect on our\n  metabolism, making red a popular color choice among fast-food\n  restaurants.... This is an important strategy for formal restaurants to increase their sales\n\n\nyou would notice bizarre thing about this paper is that this claim is unreferenced. \n\nFinally, I found a referenced academic article by Appetite which actually say the opposite: \n\nThe color red reduces snack food and soft drink intake\n\nFrom Abstract:\n\n\n  Based on evidence that the color red elicits avoidance motivation\n  across contexts (Mehta &amp; Zhu, 2009), two studies investigated the\n  effect of the color red on snack food and soft drink consumption. In\n  line with our hypothesis, participants drank less from a red labeled\n  cup than from a blue labeled cup (Study 1), and ate less snack food\n  from a red plate than from a blue or white plate (Study 2). The\n  results suggest that red functions as a subtle stop signal that works\n  outside of focused awareness and thereby reduces incidental food and\n  drink intake.\n\n\nEnough said. You may look into the studies, they seem convincing.\n\nSo, answering your question:\n\n\n  Does the color red make you hungrier?\n\n\nNot according to scientific evidence. Rob Marsh, an entrepreneur and expert with logos had an interesting opinion:\n\n\n  If you\u2019ve had a positive experience with these brands, they may\n  trigger an \u201cI\u2019d love a blizzard and fries right about now\u201d kind of\n  response. But it has very little to do with the color red.\n  \n  Color meaning is situational.\n  \n  Seeing a brand new red restaurant logo isn\u2019t likely to make you hungry\n  (at least until you connect it to a positive eating experience). And\n  it probably won\u2019t raise your heart rate. But it might catch your\n  attention\u2014especially if the red stands out from the surrounding\n  environment. That\u2019s what red does best.\n  \n  So you can probably forget those color psychology posters and\n  recommendations. Including ours. When it comes to color, a lot of\n  what\u2019s said is conjecture or just plain wrong.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6738#26883", "answerId": "26883"}

But yes, it is possible that an FDA approved additive can cause harm. \n\nTo start the use of a additive, a sponsor must submit a petition to show that the proposed use of the additive is safe. (This even is true for animal food)  The FDA reviews the petition to make the call on if the additive is as safe as the sponsor says it is.  If the petition passes, the additive gets to be used.\n\nHowever:\n\n\n  Because of inherent limitations of science, FDA can never be absolutely certain of the absence of any risk from the use of any substance. Therefore, FDA must determine - based on the best science available - if there is a reasonable certainty of no harm to consumers when an additive is used as proposed.\n\n\nSo the FDA looks into their research and determines if the additive is safe given the current data. Yet just because the FDA has reached this conclusion does not necessarily imply that the additive is safe. When further studies come out, the FDA analyzes the data and once again makes the best call they can on if the additive is safe.\n\nTake, for example, Aspartame; common low-calorie artificial sweetener.  Studies by the European Ramazzini Foundation (ERF) have concluded that the sweetener is carcinogenic.  But whenever such conclusions are made, the FDA analyzes the new data and reevaluates the safety of the additive.  The FDA issued this statement stating that they have analyzed what data from the study they could, and determined that the ERF's study does not support the conclusion that aspartame is carcinogenic.  (Incidentally, the European Food Safety Authority agrees with the FDA on this)\n\nIn summary, when the FDA approves an additive, they can only do so by making their best guess.  If someone says they've made the wrong call, they do their best to investigate the new data.  This is, of course, in general.

With adjustment for estimated energy intake,\n  an increase in meat intake of 250 g/d (eg, one steak at approximately\n  450 kcal) would lead to a 2-kg higher weight gain after 5 y (95% CI:\n  1.5, 2.7 kg).

Done correctly, it reduces the incidence of caries and periodontitis.\n\n\n  When you brush your teeth, you help remove plaque \u2014 a sticky film that forms on your teeth because of bacteria in your mouth. The bacteria in plaque causes the two major tooth-related diseases, cavities (dental caries) and gum disease (periodontitis).\n\n\nMayo clinic\n\n\n\n\n  In normal use it must be concluded that the benefits of tooth brushing far outweigh the potential harm.\n\n\nCan tooth brushing damage your health? Effects on oral and dental tissues.\n\n\n\nThe Cochrane Collaboration performed a meta-analyses of several studies:\n\n\n  The review of trials found that children aged 5 to 16 years who used a fluoridated toothpaste had fewer decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth after three years (regardless of whether their drinking water was fluoridated). Twice a day use increases the benefit.\n\n\nIn another meta-analysis, they looked at young children, and found that may be side-effects of fluoride toothpastes - a risk of fluorosis/mottling of teeth - especially in children younger than 12 months or under 5-6 years with high fluoride levels, but that for children at high-risk of tooth decay, this risk may be outweighed.\n\n\n\n\n  the human species has evolved for several million years without any teeth brushing. ...

This proved to be wrong, so they reversed that decision. No-one reported getting sick in the interval (or since).\nMicro-organisms, such as salmonella, have been detected in the product, and in hamburger meat. The manufacturer claims only 0.06% of samples contained E. coli. They also claim that their 3.6% salmonella tests figures (compared to 0.9% figures for other suppliers) are due to more stringent testing.\nIf they use too much ammonia, it smells bad. They claim that lowered the levels are still effective at killing micro-organisms. That claim is under review.\nThe USDA agrees that the ammonia itself, while smelling bad, is not dangerous.\nSome people find the process disgusting. Some people are put off by its smell before being mixed with other meat. Some people perceive it as inferior to other butchery processes. Some children prefer its taste. It is cheaper than other processes. None of this is relevant to the question.\n\n\nWhat is important to this question is that none of these points make any claims about the long-term danger of the meat. The only real health concern raised is in the short-term, viz. is the meat contaminated with Salmonella or E. coli, both of which can cause severe food-poisoning, especially in children?\n\nAnd it is clear from the article that the answer (from both officials, schools and the manufacturer) is yes, bacterial contaminations do, very occasionally, occur in the raw product. Beef Products Inc deny that it is more common than from other suppliers.\n\nNow, whether you consider the risk of infection too high for your children is a personal choice.  (Remembering it happens in other meat too, and can be ameliorated by proper food preparation, including cooking the food adequately.)\n\nI haven't tried to challenge the reporting from the article, because I believe the article does not directly make the claims that the title suggests, so there are no substantial claims that have been called into doubt by the question.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8737#10405", "answerId": "10405"}

It means that viruses shedded by a freshly vaccinated person start infecting other, unvaccinated people. A fully vaccinated population would be immune from both types of polio.\n\nQuoted from the WHO page, emphasis mine:\n\n\n  It takes a long time for a cVDPV to occur. Generally, the strain will have been allowed to circulate in an un- or under-immunized population for a period of at least 12 months. Circulating VDPVs occur when routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are poorly conducted and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. Hence, the problem is not with the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage. If a population is fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses.\n  \n  Since 2000, more than 10 billion doses of OPV have been administered to nearly 3 billion children worldwide. As a result, more than 13 million cases of polio have been prevented, and the disease has been reduced by more than 99%. During that time, 24 cVDPV outbreaks occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 VDPV cases.\n\n\nActually they felt they could remove the most problematic strain of the virus from the vaccination:\n\n\n  Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV cases were due to the type 2 component in OPV. With the transmission of wild poliovirus type 2 already successfully interrupted since 1999, in April 2016 a switch was implemented from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV in routine immunization programmes. The removal of the type 2 component of OPV is associated with significant public health benefits, including a reduction of the risk of cases of cVDPV2.\n\n\nSo allowing for the latency mentioned for cVDPV to actually occur, vaccine-derived polio cases can be expected to go down as well.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/42804#42805", "answerId": "42805"}

It also seems to depend on how long it takes to extract juice from a certain amount of fruit. The longer it takes, the more likely it has some impact.\n\nLong version: \n\nFirst, do different juicing methods affect anything about the juice they produce? There doesn't seem to be a literature on the effects of different juicers on nutrient content, but there is a modest one on the effect on flavours, juice yield, and amount of particulate in the juice. The main difference seems to be that cold pressing ends up extracting juice from only the flesh of the fruits, while \"hot pressing + maceration\" (which is an industrial process that seems similar to a blender or centrifugal method) extracts from seeds and/or skins as well. If there are nutrients that break down when heated, and are present in the flesh of the fruit, it stands to reason that cold pressing would recover them better. This paper has a good discussion of the effects in grapes, but doesn't address nutrition explicitly, only certain oils that affect the flavour.\n\nThis rather interesting book covers (starting around page 50), the different things that can affect flavour, colour, clarity, etc. of juice at small and medium production scales. Using a hot press (where the fruits are heated to ~60 degrees and possibly macerated before juicing) does have some effects. \n\nOkay, so what sorts of nutrients might break down during hot pressing? This paper shows that at least vitamin C (which is presumably a nutrient of interest in juicing) is prone to degradation at the temperature range used in hot pressing (~60 C). However, they exposed broccoli to 60 C temperatures for 10 minutes continuously to get that kind of effect, so it's unclear whether exposure during juicing would be long enough.\n\nCan a home juicer get that hot? While, a centrifugal juicer is basically a blender. I could not find any good information on the temperatures they reach (just a lot of unsourced health websites). However, there are definitely higher end blenders capable of bringing their contents to boiling or near boiling temperatures. This Cooking SE question covers how to make soup using only a blender (heat by running on high), and this blender website advertises that you may be able to boil soups in some of its models. It stands to reason then that a lower-end blender should also heat its contents, even if it doesn't go quite as fast. Since it only needs to get up to 50 or 60 C to damage e.g. vitamin C, it might be able to do that.\n\nHowever, this paper, appears to show that pomegranates juiced via blender actually yield more citric acid than those juiced by press (tables 1b and 1c). While citric acid is not a nutrient, this shows that some compounds are better extracted via blender than press, so even if say, vitamin C, extraction were reduced, some other nutrients might be present in higher amounts (maybe essential oils from the seeds?).  \n\nSo overall, what can be said is that:\n\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a real, public, study that looks at these effects directly. The juicing industry (and therefore juice science) is very concerned about how your juice looks, tastes, and smells, but doesn't seem to care about whether its nutrition is affected by the extraction method.\nThere is a plausible mechanism of action for a centrifugal juicer to degrade nutrients: spinning stuff fast and hitting it over and over makes it hot, and hot stuff tends to degrade certain types of nutrients (though if it gets too hot, the nutrients can become stable again).\nThere is also a plausible mechanism of action for a centrifugal juicer to get more nutrients: spinning stuff fast and hitting it over and over can extract things from more parts of the fruit than cold pressing it can.\n\n\nJust a maybe. It does seem like in general, cold pressed juice has better \"flavour\" properties, but hot pressing yields more actual juice though. So maybe that can help you decide what to buy.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/28180#28198", "answerId": "28198"}

If traction alopecia continues for a long time and the same hair region is repeatedly pulled out, the hair follicles in this skin region become cumulatively damaged and they may stop growing hair permanently.\n\n\nThe above calls out \"tight pony tails\" and \"tight hat bands\".  As noted in the question statement, there are some people who point out the uncertainty over loosely worn hats, e.g. from \"Will Wearing Hats Make You Go Bald?\" (2012):\n\n\n  But hats don\u2019t provide nearly enough tension to cause alopecia, Samrao says. \u201cI don\u2019t see how a hat could cause that, unless you\u2019re wearing it so tightly that it\u2019s pulling your hair.\u201d\n\n\nOther sources don't call out tightness as much.  For example, a study on why hats can cause hair loss (\"Altered Serum Micronutrient Levels in Female Alopecia Subjects with History of Prolonged Use of Cap/Scarf\" (2014)) refers to the hair loss as \"cap/scarf-induced\" without explicitly calling out tight-fitting head wear:\n\n\n  Abstract\n  \n  The etiology of most types of alopecia is not fully understood. Excessive use of hat is believed to be a cause of alopecia, but the possible involvement of altered micronutrients (essential elements and vitamins) levels in cap\\scarf- induced alopecia has not been explored. This study is therefore embarked on to identify if alteration in micronutrients levels exists in subjects who may have cap\\scarf- induced alopecia.  [...]  The result of this study suggests that altered serum levels of micronutrients and total protein may exist in individuals who may have cap\\scarf- induced alopecia.\n\n\nMost of the above seems to discuss traction alopecia, though here's a source that discusses \"traction folliculitis\", which appears to be related:  \"Traction Folliculitis: 6 Cases Caused by Different Types of Hairstyles That Pull on the Hair\" (2009):\n\n\n  Abstract\n  \n  Excessive hair traction caused by hairstyles that pull the hair too tightly may cause noninfectious mechanical and irritant folliculitis known as traction folliculitis. We present a series of 6 cases of traction folliculitis caused by different hairstyles. All patients were women aged between 12 and 26 years old. Their hairstyles were braids, ponytails, pigtails, cornrows, and hair extensions in 2 patients. The lesions consisted of small, slightly painful, follicular pustules confined to the sites of maximum hair traction and surrounded by erythema. Only in 1 case were the lesions associated with traction alopecia. In 2 cases in which bacterial cultures were done, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated. All patients improved after undoing their hairstyle and treatment with oral flucloxacillin. We assume that the role of S aureus is secondary and opportunistic, given that only follicles subject to traction and not the adjacent ones were affected.\n\n\nComments\n\nWhile there seems to be a general consensus that tight-fitting hats and hair styles can cause hair loss, there's more skepticism about loose-fitting hats and hairstyles.  This uncertainty seems to appear in a lot of cause-and-effect relationships where we're not sure if a little bit of a cause still leads to a little bit of effect.\n\nMy impression from the literature is that they're not particularly concerned because, even if wearing a hat a bit can effect a slight bit of hair loss, that's probably not something people really need to worry about.\n\nOverall, it seems that wearing one's hair with tight strains can cause hair loss, whether the strain's due to head wear or how the hair's styled.  Whether or not gentle hair strain can cause a little bit of hair loss isn't known.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/38349#38379", "answerId": "38379"}

Quite a few foods seem to pass through the system hardly digested, for example peas, when the kids cannot chew very well yet, and when their digestive system is still maturing. The only possible concern is that if mushrooms make up an important fraction of the diet, children do not get enough calories (in fact, mushrooms are supposed to help you lose weight, something you're usually trying to avoid in small children).\n\nHowever, if you understand \"difficult to digest\" as leading to \"feelings of being unwell\", the difficult-to-digest mushrooms may actually be slightly toxic. Toxicity is measured in terms of amount per body mass, so the same amount of mushrooms that leads to a slight indigestion (or not even) in an adult could have more severe consequences in a small child. Thus, if you know that specific kinds of mushrooms make you unwell, you shouldn't be giving them to a kid. \n\nIn sum, as long as you get properly sourced properly cooked (and reasonably radiation-free) mushrooms that don't make you feel unwell, and as long as these mushrooms aren't making up a large portion of the kids diet, all should be fine.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6903#6914", "answerId": "6914"}

How can black holes exist when they seem to break two fundamental laws of physics?1:\n\n\nLaws of Relativity\nQuantum Mechanics\n\n\nPBS explains:\n\n\n  Last week, famed physicist Stephen Hawking made headlines with this bold statement: \u201cthere are no black holes.\u201d\n  \n  Those words come directly from Hawking\u2019s latest paper, but they are contained within a larger point involving the mechanics of a black hole and its famous \u201cevent horizon.\u201d (That\u2019s the area thought to exist around a black hole from which nothing, not even light, can escape.) To be clear, Hawking was not claiming that black holes don\u2019t exist. Astronomers have been observing black holes for decades, said Joseph Polchinski, theoretical physicist at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n\n\nRelated: Abhas Mitra states that Hawking reached the same conclusion as a paper Mitra published in 2000.4:\n\n\n  Recent observation by NASA scientists of giant flares of X-rays from a black hole confirms his theory that the so-called black holes are not \"true\" black holes but actually ultra hot balls of fire like our Sun.2\n\n\nNASA explains further:\n\n\n  \n  This diagram shows how a shifting feature, called a corona, can create a flare of X-rays around a black hole. The corona (feature represented in purplish colors) gathers inward (left), becoming brighter, before shooting away from the black hole (middle and right). Astronomers don't know why the coronas shift, but they have learned that this process leads to a brightening of X-ray light that can be observed by telescopes.\n\n\nIn simpler terms, the classic idea of a black hole - where nothing can escape its gravitational pull - is invalid. The black hole can be seen emitting x-rays.

The purpose of ear wax is to trap particles that may enter the ear from the outside, and bring them out of the ear canal. \n\nFrom S. Gelfand - Essentials of audiology \n\n\n  Cerumen is a waxy substance that is supposed to be in the ear canal, where it serves lubricating and cleansing functions and also helps to protect the ear from bacteria, fungi, and insects. The cerumen is produced by glands in the cartilagenous portion of the ear canal and migrates out over time.  \n  \n  [cut]  \n  \n  Impacted cerumen is an accumulation of wax in the ear canal that interferes with the flow of sound in the eardrum. Impacted cerumen occurs naturally in many patients who produce excessive amount of cerumen, which builds up over time. It is also the fate of many Q-tip wielding patients who inadvertently pack cerumen farther back into the canal (and frequently against the eardrum) in an ironic attempt to clean their ears\n\n\nShould earwax be removed?\n\nThe American Academy of Otolaryngology says not to, unless it presents a medical risk.\n\nFrom their website\n\n\n  When should the ears be cleaned?\n  \n  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn\u2019t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is all cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:\n  \n  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged\n  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive\n  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear\n  Itching, odor, or discharge\n  Coughing\n\n\n\n\nVarious methods exist to remove cerumen. Wikipedia lists:\n\n\n  A number of softeners are effective; however, if this is not sufficient, the most common method of cerumen removal is syringing with warm water. A curette method is more likely to be used by otolaryngologists when the ear canal is partially occluded and the material is not adhering to the skin of the ear canal. Cotton swabs, on the other hand, push most of the earwax further into the ear canal and remove only a small portion of the top layer of wax that happens to adhere to the fibres of the swab.\n\n\nThere is also quite a bit of literature on the matter.\n\nThis paper (bear in mind that it was written in 1990, so it may not be reflecting the current situation), surveys 289 practitioners about \"the methods of removing ear wax [...] and the incidence of associated complications\". \n\nEar wax removal: a survey of current practice - Sharp et al. 1990\n\n\n  The 289 replies received (92% of the study group) indicated that each doctor saw an average of nine patients (range five to 50 or more) requesting the removal of ear wax per month (table I). The initial medical assessment was made by 179 general practitioners\n  (62%). No medical assessment was made by 23 (8%); these patients were referred directly to the practice nurse. The remaining 87 (30%) offered examination by either the doctor or nurse.\n\n\nThe most used method of wax removal was syringing a ceruminolytic agent (something that melts the wax, such as oil or bicarbonate or special formulations), either done directly by the doctor or by a nurse.\n\nThe paper reports that\n\n\n  Complications had been experienced by 105 practitioners (38%) and included perforation, canal lacerations, and failure of wax removal. The removal of occlusive wax improved hearing by a mean of 5 dB over the frequencies analysed.\n\n\nand concludes that:\n\n\n  About 44000 ears are syringed each year in the area and complications requiring specialist referral are estimated to occur in 1/1000 ears syringed. The incidence of complications could be reduced by a greater awareness of the potential hazards, increased instruction of personnel, and more careful selection of patients.\n\n\nA more recent systematic review of clinical trials can be found in\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of different methods of earwax removal: a systematic review and economic evaluation. - Clegg et al. 2010\n\nThey analyzed 22 randomised controlled trials and 4 controlled clinical trials, using different types of softeners, with or without irrigation.\n\nThey report that:\n\n\n  On measures of wax clearance Cerumol, sodium bicarbonate, olive oil and water are all more effective than no treatment; triethanolamine polypeptide (TP) is better than olive oil; wet irrigation is better than dry irrigation; sodium bicarbonate drops followed by irrigation by nurse is more effective than sodium bicarbonate drops followed by self-irrigation; softening with TP and self-irrigation is more effective than self-irrigation only; and endoscopic de-waxing is better than microscopic de-waxing. AEs (adverse events) appeared to be minor and of limited extent. Results of the exploratory economic model found that softeners followed by self-irrigation were more likely to be cost-effective [24,433 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)] than softeners followed by irrigation at primary care (32,130 pounds per QALY) when compared with no treatment. Comparison of the two active treatments showed that the additional gain associated with softeners followed by irrigation at primary care over softeners followed by self-irrigation was at a cost of 340,000 pounds per QALY. When compared over a lifetime horizon to the 'no treatment' option, the ICERs for softeners followed by self-irrigation and of softeners followed by irrigation at primary care were 24,450 pounds per QALY and 32,136 pounds per QALY, respectively.\n\n\nThey conclude that:\n\n\n  Although softeners are effective, which specific softeners are most effective remains uncertain. Evidence on the effectiveness of methods of irrigation or mechanical removal was equivocal. Further research is required to improve the evidence base, such as a RCT incorporating an economic evaluation to assess the different ways of providing the service, the effectiveness of the different methods of removal and the acceptability of the different approaches to patients and practitioners.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5722#5754", "answerId": "5754"}

The abstract reads:\n\n\n  The life settings in which sudden death may occur can be classified into eight categories: 1 on the impact of the collapse or death of a close person; 2 during acute grief; 3 on threat of loss of a close person; [4] during mourning or on an anniversary; [5] on loss of status or self-esteem; [6] personal danger or threat of injury; [7] after the danger is over; [8] reunion, triumph, or happy ending. Common to all is that they involve events impossible for the victims to ignore and to which their response is overwhelming excitation or giving up, or both. It is proposed that this combination provokes neurovegetative responses, involving both the flight-fight and conservation-withdrawal systems, conducive to lethal cardiac events, particularly in individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease; other modes of death, however, were also noted. Better understanding of the potentially lethal life situations and identification of individuals at risk may lead to the development of practical prophylactic measures. \n\n\nOther sources claim that Voodoo Death is caused not by an actual curse, but by the fear of the victim of the curse. I don't have access to the paper, which is cited as\n\n\n  Voodoo and Sudden Death: The Effects of Expectations on Health Transcultural Psychiatry January 1, 1982 19:75-92 \n\n\nIn conclusion, it appears that this phenomenon exists and is under scientific investigation.\n\nAs for the sudden whitening: There are some historic cases, but these most likely did not happen \"overnight\", but rather over weeks and months. In addition, hair did not suddenly turn white, but rather a mixture of pigmented and white hair was already present, and the pigmented hair fell out. A nice overview is given in this paper. A relevant passage:\n\n\n  While these theories hardly stand up to even indulgent criticism, there is one explanation which appears plausible. Alopecia areata is a disease in which either patchy or diffuse hair los occurs, often in a matter of days and sometimes to an alarming degree. The cause is unknown. Many times a psychic event has been linked to its onset, but whether this was a post or praeter hoc relation is disputed. For unknown reasons the hair loss in alopecia areata confines itself almost exclusively to pigmented hairs; white hairs remain. Moreover when hair regrows in areas of previous loss, it often does so without restoration of its previous color. It is reasonable that in a person who had a mixture of pigmented and white hair, in whom rapid, difuse pigmented hair loss occurred, would appear to have grown white overnight.\n\n\nFor some of the historical cases, there appears to be another, much more banal explanation, found in this more recent historical overview:\n\n\n  The use of temporary hair dyes prior to 1907 may explain some cases of sudden canities. When incarcerated and sentenced to death, it is unlikely that individuals would have access to hair dye or servants to aid application.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2019#2020", "answerId": "2020"}

Most fountain soda systems allow the owner to adjust the ratio of carbonated water to syrup, as well as the temperature and amount of ice that gets served to you in the cup. All of those will affect flavor, to varying degrees. \n\nContainer Taste\n\nxiaohouzi79 provides some good references that plastic containers may impart flavors on the finished product, and this article from Slate suggests that metal cans also will change the flavor of the soda, although this effect gets diminished as can-lining technology gets better. \n\nCarbonation Leakage\n\nThat same Slate Article claims that plastic is also more CO2-permeable than aluminum, which will (over time) mean that the plastic bottle will yield \"flatter\" soda than the aluminum can. I suppose a similar question could be asked about the quality of the seal between the metal cap and the glass bottle. Differing levels of carbonation will affect the \"mouthfeel\" and also the taste by means of Carbonic Acid\n\nOther effects\n\nDifferent containers will retain heat differently (conductors vs. insulators), which will affect how the soda tastes in your mouth as well as how the can, bottle, or cup feels on your hand and lips (not strictly part of taste, but affects the soda-drinking experience). \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3000#4164", "answerId": "4164"}
{"question": "Does listening to negative emotive music help dealing with negative emotions?", "questionId": "7531", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7531", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Violent or anti-social music lyrics may provide a short-term catharsis for depression and feelings of alienation, by giving the listener the company that mysery is said to crave.\n\nIn larger doses, however, the negative emotions expressed in those songs are apt to work at ingraining the attitudes they portray in their lyrics into the minds of their listeners, thus reinforcing the feelings of depression and sometimes by validating thoughts of violence or suicide. (Shneidman and Farberow, 1994)\n\nSometimes, when addiction to heavy metal or rap music becomes extreme, a \"media delinquency\" can develop, when the music becomes an actual contributory factor in a person's thoughts, decision-making and behavior. (Pezdek &amp; Roe, 1995)\n\nFinally, Goleman states (1995):\n\n\n  To immerse oneself in angry, desperate, depressing music is a poor strategy for coping with anger, despair, and depression. Neuroscience suggests that\n  'brooding,' or dwelling on one\u2019s current emotional state, is more likely to\n  deepen the state rather than to alleviate it.\n\n\nOn a brief personal note, I can tell you from first-hand experience how a person's choice of music can backfire on them. My husband (now ex-) has always listened to heavy metal head-banger stuff since I've known him. When we were 20, it was not such a big deal, I guess. But as the years passed, it was like the pissed off teen rebel \"I hate my parents and I'll do what I want\" theme somehow stunted his emotional growth. I have long believed that the 4 to upward of 10 hours each day he has spent listening to angry, depressing anti-social lyrics as though they were a personal anthem has seriously affected his brain and the way he thinks and views himself and the rest of the world. \"Hate Rock,\" I always called it.\n\nSo to answer the question: Yes, listening to sad music while a person is feeling sad themselves can be cathartic and is a matter of personal choice of whether to deal with their feelings that way. BUT, beware the negative effects of over-indulgence, especially in those prone to addictive behavior. (Pezdek &amp; Roe, 1995) \n\n\nThe Psychology of Suicide : Edwin S. Shneidman, Norman L.

Those who maintained their goal weight, as opposed to those who regained, tended to have several things in common: they attended classes after reaching goal weight in the same locations and with the same lecturers that assissted their weight loss; they had lower initial weights: they conceived of themselves as 'overweight' when they were approximately three pounds above goal; they had improved self-concepts; they made more lifestyle changes supporting weight maintenance; and they continued, after goal, use of many of the techniques used to reach goal weight. \n\n\nSo, longer-term, Weight Watchers remained effective for most of them, especially those who stuck to the program.\n\nFive Years After Hitting Goal Weight, Keeping the Weight Off\n\n\nMichael R.

It may improve a bit movement range and reduces stiffness and pain.\n\nWhen it comes to rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, gout and infectious arthritis there's nothing that passive movement can do due to the etiology of these conditions. Autoimmune arthritis (rheumatoid and lupic) requires immunosupressive therapy. Gout requires lowering uric acid blood levels. Infectious arthritis requires antibiotherapy [1].\n\n\n  Damage from mechanical stress with insufficient self repair by joints is believed to be the primary cause of osteoarthritis. Sources of this stress may include: misalignments of bones caused by congenital or pathogenic causes; mechanical injury; excess body weight; loss of strength in the muscles supporting a joint; and impairment of peripheral nerves, leading to sudden or uncoordinated movements. However exercise, including running in the absence of injury, has not been found to increase the risk [2].\n  \n  Cartilage has limited repair capabilities: Because chondrocytes are bound in lacunae, they cannot migrate to damaged areas. Therefore cartilage damage is difficult to heal. Also, because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply, the deposition of new matrix is slow. Damaged hyaline cartilage is usually replaced by fibrocartilage scar tissue [3].\n\n\nA study made on rabbits in 1980 says that continuous passive movement helps:\n\n\n  At three weeks this assessment revealed that in the adolescent rabbits, healing of the defects by hyaline articular cartilage was present in 5 per cent of forty defects in ten animals whose knees were immobilized, in 9 per cent of forty defects in ten animals whose knees were permitted intermittent active motion, and in 52 per cent of forty defects in ten animals whose knees were managed immediately after operation by continuous passive motion [4].\n\n\nHowever, more recent studies  and reviews (although after surgery - when the etiological agent has been removed/suppressed, misalignments have been corrected) fail to confirm that on humans:\n\n\n  There is high-quality evidence that continuous passive motion increases passive knee flexion range of motion (mean difference 2 degrees, 95% CI 0 to 5) and active knee flexion range of motion (mean difference 3 degrees, 95% CI 0 to 6). These effects are too small to be clinically worthwhile. There is low-quality evidence that continuous passive motion has no effect on length of hospital stay (mean difference -0.3 days; 95% CI -0.9 to 0.2) but reduces the need for manipulation under anaesthesia (relative risk 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.70) [5].\n  \n  Continuous passive motion is commonly used postoperatively following cartilage surgery. Unfortunately, the clinical evidence (only 4 studies) to support the use of continuous passive motion is lacking despite an overwhelming abundance of basic science support and the common clinical practice of continuous passive motion implementation postoperatively in knee cartilage restoration procedures. There is a great need for well-conducted, high-level evidence studies to address this void in our literature [6].\n  \n  The lack of consistent standardized reporting of postoperative CPM protocols provides an impetus to researchers and clinicians to more clearly define and describe their use following knee articular surgery [7].\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nWikipedia contributors, \"Arthritis,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthritis&amp;oldid=615702031 (accessed July 9, 2014).\nWikipedia contributors, \"Osteoarthritis,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Osteoarthritis&amp;oldid=615716855 (accessed July 9, 2014).\nWikipedia contributors, \"Cartilage,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cartilage&amp;oldid=614202865 (accessed July 9, 2014).\nSalter RB, Simmonds DF, Malcolm BW, Rumble EJ, MacMichael D, Clements ND.

Several\n  cultures have independently viewed the\n  main function of language as the\n  expression of thought. Ancient Indian\n  grammarians speak of the soul\n  apprehending things with the intellect\n  and inspiring the mind with a desire\n  to speak, and in the Greek\n  intellectual tradition Aristotle\n  declared, \u201cSpeech is the\n  representation of the experiences of\n  the mind\u201d (On Interpretation). Such an\n  attitude passed into Latin theory and\n  thence into medieval doctrine.\n  Medieval grammarians envisaged three\n  stages in the speaking process: things\n  in the world exhibit properties; these\n  properties are understood by the minds\n  of humans; and, in the manner in which\n  they have been understood, so they are\n  communicated to others by the\n  resources of language. Rationalist\n  writers on language in the 17th\n  century gave essentially a similar\n  account: speaking is expressing\n  thoughts by signs invented for the\n  purpose, and words of different\n  classes (the different parts of\n  speech) came into being to correspond\n  to the different aspects of thinking.\n  - source\n\n\n\nWilhelm von Humboldt: Credited as an originator of the linguistic relativity hypothesis (aka: the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis).\nBenjamin Lee Whorf: Widely known for his ideas about linguistic relativity, the hypothesis that language influences thought.\nNoam Chomsky: Well known in the academic and scientific community as one of the fathers of modern linguistics.\n\n\n\n  On the one hand, most people, after\n  hearing evidence that language is an\n  innate faculty of humans, would not be\n  surprised to learn that it comes from\n  the same source that every other\n  complex innate aspect of the human\n  brain and body comes from \u2014 namely,\n  natural selection. But two very\n  prominent people deny this conclusion,\n  and they aren't just any old prominent\n  people, but Stephen Jay Gould,\n  probably the most famous person who\n  has written on evolution, and Noam\n  Chomsky, the most famous person who\n  has written on language. They've\n  suggested that language appeared as a\n  by- product of the laws of growth and\n  form of the human brain, or perhaps as\n  an accidental by-product of selection\n  for something else, and they deny that\n  language is an adaptation.

Homo habilis showed up 2.4 mya and stayed around for a million years. They had one, and only one, great idea: Stone tools. Next up was Homo erectus (1.5 \u2013 0.2 mya). Erectus was a slow starter but about 400,000 years ago they hit pay-dirt: Controlled use of Fire. Great. For 2.2 million years of effort we have some sharp rocks and a barbeque.\n\nThen things get really interesting.....\n\n\n  Any innovation must take place within\n  a species, since there is no place\n  else it can do so. Natural selection\n  is, moreover, not a creative force. It\n  merely works on variations that come\n  into existence spontaneously\u2014it cannot\n  call innovations into existence just\n  because they might be advantageous.\n  Any new structure or aptitude has to\n  be in place before it can be exploited\n  by its possessors, and it may take\n  some time for those possessors to\n  discover all the uses of such\n  novelties. Such seems to have been the\n  case for Homo sapiens in that the\n  earliest well-documented members of\n  our species appear to have behaved in\n  broadly the same manner as\n  Neanderthals for many tens of\n  thousands of years. It is highly\n  unlikely that another species\n  anatomically indistinguishable from\n  Homo sapiens but behaviorally similar\n  to Neanderthals was supplanted\n  worldwide in an extremely short span\n  of time. Therefore, it seems\n  appropriate to conclude that a latent\n  capacity for symbolic reasoning was\n  present when anatomically modern Homo\n  sapiens emerged and that our forebears\n  discovered their radically new\n  behavioral abilities somewhat later in\n  time.\n  \n  A cultural \u201crelease mechanism\u201d of some\n  sort was necessarily involved in this\n  discovery, and the favoured candidate\n  for this role is language, the\n  existence of which cannot be inferred\n  with any degree of confidence from the\n  records left behind by any other\n  species but our own. Language is the\n  ultimate symbolic activity, involving\n  the creation and manipulation of\n  mental symbols and permitting the\n  posing of questions such as \u201cWhat if?\u201d\n  Not all components of human thought\n  are symbolic (the human brain has a\n  very long accretionary, evolutionary\n  history that still governs the way\n  thoughts and feelings are processed),\n  but it is certainly the addition of\n  symbolic manipulations to intuitive\n  processes that makes possible what is\n  recognized as the human mind.\n  \n  The origins of this mind are obscure\n  indeed, especially as scientists are\n  still ignorant of how a mass of\n  electrochemical signals in the brain\n  gives rise to what we experience as\n  consciousness. But the invention of\n  language would plausibly have released\n  the earliest of the cultural and\n  technological innovations that\n  symbolic thought makes possible\u2014in the\n  process unleashing a cascade of\n  discoveries that is still ongoing. One\n  of the most striking features of the\n  archaeological record that accompanies\n  the arrival of behaviorally modern\n  Homo sapiens is a distinct alteration\n  in the tempo of innovation and change.\n  Significant cultural and technological\n  novelties had previously been rare,\n  with long periods of apparent\n  stability intervening between\n  relatively sudden episodes of\n  innovation. But once behaviorally\n  modern Homo sapiens arrived on the\n  scene, different local technological\n  traditions\u2014and, by extension, other\n  forms of cultural diversity\u2014began to\n  proliferate regularly, setting a pace\n  that is still gathering today.\n  - source\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line   \n\nWhen you look into the eyes of the one you love and think of what they mean to you...\nWhat language do you think in ? \n\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs, Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers\u2019 eyes, Being vexed, a sea nourished with lovers\u2019 tears.

Simple pooling of fatal event frequencies from only those studies specifically reporting the number of fatal ADRs, as was done in the meta-analysis of Lazarou and colleagues, is likely to dramatically overestimate the death rate.\n  \n  CONCLUSION:\n  Meta-analysis was invalid because of heterogeneity of the studies. Most of these studies did not report the data needed for incidence calculations. The methodology used was seriously flawed, and no conclusions regarding ADR incidence rates in the hospitalized population in the United States should be made on the basis of the original meta-analysis.\n\nThe second reference is Increase in US medication-error deaths between 1983 and 1993. I haven't read it but this letter says says that it \"reports an increase in medication-error deaths in the USA from 2876 in 1983 to 7391 in 1993\": which is much smaller than 106,000 in 2000. The letter also says (regarding UK data) that \"suspected\" ADRs are 150 times higher than death-certified ADRs.\n\n\nIn summary the extremely high number is widely reported, but disputed in a subsequent study; and is probably based on estimates rather than officially-reported and certified cause-of-death.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/18887#18888", "answerId": "18888"}

{"question": "Do condoms have large enough holes for HIV to pass through?", "questionId": "3167", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3167", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "Concerning the question of whether the HIV virus can pass through condoms, the answer appears to depends on the type and condition of the condom.\n\nThe first question is, what kind of condoms?  It seems that the available internet literature readily acknowledges that: \n\n\n  \u201cCondoms manufactured from latex are\n  the most popular, and studies\n  conducted on the ability of condoms to\n  prevent the transmission of STDs and\n  HIV most often involve latex condoms.\n  Condoms manufactured from lambskin,\n  also known as \"natural skin,\" or\n  \"natural membrane,\" are made from the\n  intestinal lining of lambs. While\n  these condoms can prevent pregnancy,\n  they contain small pores that may\n  permit passage of some STDs, including\n  HIV, the hepatitis B virus, and the\n  herpes simplex virus.\u201d\n\n\nThese kinds of condoms were not widely available at one time. Users would be well advised to recognize this point in making their condom selection if the interest is to avoid the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (\u201cSTD\u201ds), including AIDS.\n\nIncidentally, presumably, natural membrane condoms presumably make dandy water balloons. Likewise, rubber gloves are \u201cwater tight\u201d but HIV can pass through the pores in rubber gloves, which is why the latex used for condoms is manufactured to more rigorous specifications.  According to Straight Dope:\n\n\n  I'll say. Your clip is a 1992 letter\n  to the editor from Mike Roland, editor\n  of Rubber Chemistry and Technology, a\n  publication of the American Chemical\n  Society. Roland argued that \"the\n  rubber comprising latex condoms has\n  intrinsic voids [pores] about 5\n  microns (0.00002 inches) in size.\n  Since this is roughly 10 times smaller\n  than sperm, the latter are effectively\n  blocked.... Contrarily, the AIDS virus\n  is only 0.1 micron (4 millionths of an\n  inch) in size. Since this is a factor\n  of 50 smaller than the voids inherent\n  in rubber, the virus can readily pass\n  through.\" \n  \n  This sounds scary, but there are a\n  couple problems with it. First, Roland\n  bases his statement about a 5 micron\n  latex pore size on a study of rubber\n  gloves, not condoms. The U.S. Public\n  Health Service says that condoms are\n  manufactured to higher standards than\n  gloves. Condoms are dipped in the\n  latex twice, gloves only once. If just\n  4 out of 1,000 condoms fail the leak\n  test, the whole batch is rejected; the\n  standard for gloves is 40 out of\n  1,000. A study of latex condoms by the\n  National Institutes of Health using an\n  electron microscope found no holes at\n  a magnification of 2000.\n\n\nThis seems to be the an article on the original report on holes in latex gloves.\n\nSo, the point that HIV molecules are larger than water is a \u201cred herring\u201d with respect to determining whether condoms are useful to preventing the transmission of HIV. \n\nSecond, and a more precise question is, can HIV pass through latex condoms?\n\nAs the Straight Dope quote indicates, there was an FDA report indicating that under extreme test conditions \u2013 certainly unlikely to replicated in actual performance -  HIV viruses were found to have passed through latex condoms.  \n\nInternet literature from AIDS information sites - that do not seem to have an \"anti-condom\" agenda - seem to agree that the \u201cpores\u201d in latex condoms are approximately .5 microns in size, whereas the HIV virus size is .1 microns.  See this Arizona health site for corroboration.\n\nThere seems to be some dispute as to whether infection can occur through the virus alone. According to Straight Dope:\n\n\n  As for the substantive issue you\n  raise, it's true \"the transmission of\n  HIV by genital fluids most probably\n  occurs through virus-infected cells\n  since they can be present in larger\n  numbers than free virus in the body\n  fluids\" (Jay Levy, \"Pathogenesis of\n  Human Immunodeficiency Virus\n  Infection,\" Microbiological Reviews,\n  March 1993--an exhaustive treatment of\n  the subject). But it would be wrong to\n  construe this to mean that HIV is\n  transmitted only by cells. When I\n  spoke to Dr. Levy he readily conceded\n  that HIV may be transmitted by free\n  virus as well. He did add that the\n  viscosity of semen may hinder the\n  passage of such virus through the\n  latex barrier.\n\n\nIf this information is outdated it would be nice to know.\n\nA lot of internet sources quote the \u201cfactoid\u201d that condoms have \u201cpores\u201d of .5 microns in size.  I suspect from my efforts to chase down the source of this information that it may come from the 1992 report based on an examination of latex gloves noted above.  This site directly addresses the \u201cpore hypothesis\u201d and concludes that the double layers of latex in condoms prevents the formation of holes or pores that go through the entire condoms. That seems to be the best explanation for the anomaly of HIV not passing through condoms like \"bullets through a netting.\"\n\nSo, the answer seems to be that outside of artificially created circumstances and assuming properly manufactured, non-defective, non-deteriorated condoms, the HIV virus will not pass through latex condoms.\n\nThird, an even more precise question, is whether HIV can pass through condoms under ordinary usage?\n\nA caveat to arguments about the effectiveness of condoms is always that they have to be used properly and invariably.  Proper usage involves more than mechanics.  Health sites often contain warnings that deterioration, and opening up condom practices with teeth or nails, can introduce tears into the condoms.  For example, Health Communities.com states:   \n\n\n  Condoms should be purchased from a\n  source that can guarantee product\n  reliability and freshness. Heat,\n  pressure, and age can break down\n  latex. Condoms should not be used more\n  than 5 years after the manufacture\n  date. If the condom looks deteriorated\n  or discolored, or feels sticky or\n  brittle, it should be discarded. If\n  the packaging is torn or damaged, the\n  condoms should not be used.\n  \n  Condoms are easily torn if they are\n  handled roughly or with sharp\n  fingernails, so care should be taken\n  while putting them on and taking them\n  off. Petroleum or oil-based lubricants\n  (e.g., Vaseline, baby oil) can break\n  down latex and should not be used.\n  Water-based lubricants (e.g., KY\n  Jelly) should be used and are usually\n  labeled \"For use with latex condoms or\n  diaphragms.\"\n\n\nHence, fresh out of the box condoms provide a level of protection that may not be found in one left in a wallet or the glove compartment.\n\nFourth, even if all things go right, are condoms always effective?\n\nThe answer is clearly \u201cno,\u201d as suggested by the 4 out of 1,000 flaw rate mentioned above. \n\nAccording to this site: \n\n\n  Generally, the condom's effectiveness\n  at preventing HIV transmission is\n  estimated to be 87%, but it may be as\n  low as 60% or as high as 96%.\n  Conclusions: Consistent use of condoms\n  provides protection from HIV. The\n  level of protection approximates 87%,\n  with a range depending upon the\n  incidence among condom nonusers. Thus,\n  the condom's efficacy at reducing\n  heterosexual transmission may be\n  comparable to or slightly lower than\n  its effectiveness at preventing\n  pregnancy.  Family Planning\n  Perspectives, 1999, 31(6):272-279\n\n\nCondoms are clearly effective in decreasing the odds of being infected, but, clearly they are not absolutely effective.  It appears, though, that the risk of infection from an HIV viruses making its way through a non-defective, non-compromised condom is de minimis. One, however, should not be entirely sanguine about the effectiveness of condoms under all circumstances. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3167#3218", "answerId": "3218"}

{"question": "Does the Eneloop battery have lower self-discharge?", "questionId": "11224", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/11224", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "Yes, low self-discharge (LSD) NiMH batteries function as described. By the way, the Eneloop brand, by Sanyo, is not the only LSD battery on the market. Other LSD NiMH batteries are sometimes marketed as \"hybrid,\" or \"pre-charged\" NiMH batteries. Duracell \"StayCharged\" and Panasonic EVOLTA batteries are other good alternatives.\n\nHere's the basic method of why these batteries self-discharge at such a lower rate than traditional NiMH cells:\n\nEvery battery cell has an anode and a cathode. Most batteries are just several cells placed together in a series (to increase voltage), or in parallel (to increase capacity). It is common to see a combination of series and parallel to achieve specific voltages and reserve capacity.\n\nIn order to keep the cells from shorting themselves out, a separator has to be placed between the anode and cathode (negative and positive electrodes, respectively) that also allows the transport of ionic charge carriers, which are needed to complete the circuit during the passage of current.\n\nThe more efficient this separator is at isolating and separating the cathode and anode from each other, the longer it will take to self-discharge the cell.\n\nA separator generally consists of a polymeric membrane forming a micro-porous layer. It must be chemically and electro-chemically stable towards the electrolyte and electrode materials, while remaining durable enough to withstand the high tension of battery construction. Their structure and properties considerably affect the battery performance, including the batteries energy and power densities, cycle life, and safety.\n\nHaving a thinner separator inside the cell provides the space necessary to increase its capacity, which leads to longer shelf life (requiring more time to discharge at the same rate) as well as longer application use.\n\nThe more efficient the separator is at trapping shuttle substances, the slower the battery will self-discharge. This is all evident in a study done some time ago:\n\n\n  The suppression mechanism of the self-discharge reaction in nickel-metal hydride batteries using a sulfonated polyolefin separator was investigated with sealed-type AA size cells. The experimental results indicate that a sulfonated polyolefin separator effectively suppresses the self-discharge reaction in nickel-metal hydride batteries by trapping nitrogen-containing redox shuttle substances. It is also found that a sulfonated polyolefin separator traps the shuttle substances as gaseous ammonia. In the experiment examining the influence of the amount of the shuttle substances on the self-discharge, the starting point of the self-discharge agreed well with the point at which the nitrogen adsorption capacity of a sulfonated polyolefin separator reached its maximum.\n\n\nSuppression mechanism of the self-discharge reaction in nickel-metal hydride batteries using a sulfonated polyolefin separator, from the Research on Chemical Intermediates journal, Volume 32, Number 5 (2006), 453-459.\n\nI hope this answers your question.\n\nTL;DR: Yes, they last longer/self-discharge slower.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/11224#12426", "answerId": "12426"}

(I am not including nutrients under 5% DV or sugars).\n\nThe juice of one medium orange (about 86g)  contains 0.6g protein, 0.2g fiber, 72% DV Vitamin C, 5% DV thiamin, 6% DV folate, 5% DV K+, 1% DV  Ca2+.\n\nSo by not including the pulp, you miss: 0.6g protein, 2.9g fiber, 44% DV vitamin C, 3% DV thiamin, 4% DV folate, 2% DV K+, and 4% DV  Ca2+.\n\nApples vs. Apple juice\n\nOne medium apple with skin (about 180g) contains 0.5g protein, 4.4g fiber, 14% DV vitamin C, 5% DV vitamin K, 6% DV K+.\n\nThe juice of one medium apple (about 120g) contains 0.1g protein, 0.2g fiber, 1% DV vitamin C, no vitamin K,  3% DV K+. \n\nAgain, if you consume just the juice with no pulp or skin, you miss: 0.4g protein, 4.2g fiber, 13% DV vitamin C, 3% DV K+, and all 5% DV of the vitamin K.\n\nThe pulp and rinds of fruits and vegetables contain different amounts of nutrients than the flesh. This is more true in fruits like apples and oranges than in carrots and beets. Carrots and beets don't have a 'rind' and have brightly-colored flesh and juice, while an apple has certain nutrients that can only be found in the skin. In particular, if you drink only the juice you'll miss most of the fiber and protein.\n\nOverall, you do get more nutrients consuming the whole thing - consider blending instead of juicing, maybe. Quality is subjective, so I won't address it.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5130#10214", "answerId": "10214"}
{"question": "Is animal agriculture responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than transportation?", "questionId": "23920", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/23920", "category": "climate-change", "categoryId": 1, "answer": "Yes.  In fact, some sources calculate that the FAO figure is actually an underestimate.\n\nA frequently cited study on the topic is Steinfeld et al. (2006).  This is the FAO study already mention in the question.  It has 1503 citations on Google Scholar, although only 40 in the more conservative Scopus.  I am not sure if it is peer-reviewed.\n\nTo judge its quality, we could look at what other scientific studies have to say about it.  To pick one, here it is summarised by Koneswaran et al. (2008):\n\n\n  Although much evidence has been amassed on the negative impacts of animal agricultural production on environmental integrity, community sustainability, public health, and animal welfare, the global impacts of this sector have remained largely underestimated and underappreciated. In a recent review of the relevant data, Steinfeld et al. (2006) calculated the sector\u2019s contributions to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and determined them to be so significant that\u2014measured in carbon dioxide equivalent\u2014the emissions from the animal agricultural sector surpass those of the transportation sector.\n\n\nThe FAO report is also cited by the IPCC AR WG3 report.\n\nA more recent study by Goodland and Anhang (not peer reviewed, but cited by at least 19 Scopus-indexed studies) claims that the FAO study actually underestimates livestock's contribution:\n\n\n  A widely cited 2006 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Livestock's Long Shadow, estimates that 18 percent of annual worldwide GHG emissions are attributable to cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, pigs, and poultry. But recent analysis by Goodland and Anhang finds that livestock and their byproducts actually account for at least 32.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, or 51 percent of annual worldwide GHG emissions.\n\n\nSee also this article in The Independent which discusses the Goodland and Anhang paper.  A further study is by Garnett (2011) (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  While there are no studies that quantify GHG emissions arising from the entire global food chain, there have been estimates of GHGs attributable to global agricultural production. The IPCC estimates agriculture\u2019s direct impacts to stand at about 10\u201312% of global emissions (5100\u20136100 MTCO2 eq); this excludes emissions resulting from fuel use, fertiliser production and agriculturally induced land use change (Smith et al., 2007).\n  \n  The figure rises to up to 30% when additional emissions from fuel use, fertiliser production and agriculturally induced land use change are included; land use change alone accounts for 6\u201317% (Bellarby et al., 2008).\n  \n  One regional analysis for Europe finds that food accounts for 31% of the EU-25\u2019s total GHG impacts, with a further 9% arising from the hotel and restaurants sector (European Commission, 2006). At the national level, developed country studies find food consumption contributes between 15% and 28% to overall national emissions (Garnett, 2008, Defra, 2009, Audsley et al., 2010, Swedish Environment Protection Agency, 2010, Regional Activity Centre for Cleaner Production, 2008, Nieberg, 2009, Kim and Neff, 2009 and Consuming Australia, 2007). Fig. 2 shows the breakdown of emissions at each stage in the supply chain for the UK food system. One UK study (Audsley et al., 2010) additionally quantifies emissions associated with food consumption-induced land use change and finds that this increases the food chain\u2019s overall GHG contribution by 66%.\n\n\nHowever, the Garnett paper considers both animal and non-animal agriculture, so these figures cannot be directly compared.  However, they go on to state:\n\n\n  Since livestock utilise around 80% of the world\u2019s agricultural land (FAO, 2009) and generate the bulk of the sector\u2019s GHGs, there is a perception that efforts to raise livestock yields can generate both environmental and commercial benefits. \n\n\nIn summary: exact methodologies differ and it can be difficult to compare figures, a literature survey did not show significant disagreement with the FAO study.  Do trucks with animals count as animal agriculture?  Do trucks with meat?\n\nStudies that I found that disagreed rather considered that the FAO underestimated animal-agriculture-induced emissions, than that they overestimated it.  So: Yes, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than transportation.\n\n\nSteinfeld H, Gerber P, Wassenaar T, Castel V, Rosales M, de Haan C.

And it is very probably a quite terrible idea from a health perspective. It is definitively a terrible idea from a taste perspective. After reviewing the available literature for claims and results we have to conclude that there is no evidence to support these claims. Two experts who should really know the literature on this confirm this with  testimonials found quoted at the end of this answer.\n\n\n\nThere are some studies in scientific journals that seem to indicate some qualities of bovine urine that may point into the therapeutic direction:\n\n\n  Kuldeep Dhama: \"Anti-Cancer Activity of Cow Urine: Current Status and Future Directions\", International Journal of Cow Science, 1(2): 1-25, 2005    \n  \n  Cow urine has a unique place in Ayurveda and has been described in \u2018Sushrita Samhita\u2019 and \u2018Ashtanga Sangraha\u2019 to be the most effective substance/secretion of animal origin with innumerable therapeutic values. It has been recognized as water of life or \u201cAmrita\u201d (beverages of immotality), the nector of the God. In India, drinking of cow urine has been practiced for thousands of years. It is an important ingredient of panchgavya, a term used to describe five major substances (urine, milk, ghee, curd and dung), obtained from cow. All the five products possess medicinal properties, and are used singly or in combination with some other herbs against many diseases, even those not curable by allopathic treatments. This kind of alternative treatment, termed as \u2018panchgavya therapy\u2019 or \u2018cowpathy\u2019, has been reported to be beneficial even for dreaded diseases like cancer, AIDS and diabetes. Practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine from India routinely use cow urine as a remedy and the medicines made from it are used to cure several diseases. Improvements have been shown or reported with those suffering from flu, allergies, colds, rheumatoid arthritis, bacterial/viral infections, tuberculosis, chicken pox, hepatitis, leucorrhoea, leprosy, ulcer, heart disease, asthma, skin infections, aging, chemical intoxication etc. Cow urine can kill the number of drug resistant bacteria and viruses. Recently the cow urine has been granted U.S. Patents (No. 6896907 and 6,410,059) for its medicinal properties, particularly for its use along with antibiotics for the control of bacterial infection and fight against cancers. \n\n\nThe whole substance is thought of as miracle drug \u2013\u2013 in some regions and belief systems \u2013\u2013 that is said to fight almost all diseases at once,\n\n\n  \u2018The cow\u2019 is a mobile medical dispensary and cow urine is a panacea of all diseases. (Mohanty: Int J Pharm Pharm Sci, Vol 6, Issue 3, 20-22, 2014.)\n\n\nThe arguments found in favour of this substance often emphasise that it has US patents granted to its use in medicine and even comes from a sacred animal as its waste product, that is without harming the animal?\n\nLet's start to look at the patents:\nUS6410059 and US6896907. They were granted on the basis that cow urine is a \"bioenhancer\", not a medicine in itself. That may have some value. But the argument is peripheral to the claim of cow urine as health drink and scientific or medical information found in patents does not have be reliable.\n\nWhat quality is to be found in those research articles that claim to find and present evidence? Usually it goes like this:\n\n\n  N. K. Jain et al.: \"Efficacy Of Cow Urine Therapy On Various Cancer Patients In Mandsaur District, India - A Survey\", International Journal of Green Pharmacy, Vol 4, No 1 (2010)\n  Evaluation of cow urine therapy on cancer patients in 8 days camp at Mandsaur district was carried out. The object of this survey was to evaluate efficacy of cow urine therapy on various cancer patients who were reported across from different state of India. Total 68 cancer patients reported during the survey from 8 April 2007 to 15 April 2007. A questionnaire was developed to assess the efficacy of cow urine therapy. During survey, out of 68 patients, 7.35% patients withdraw themselves from the treatment and 63 (92.64%) patients continued the therapy. There was a high proportion (30.87%) of throat cancer and the other prevalent cancer was breast cancer (14.70%) followed by cervix and uterine cancer (5.88%), buccal cavity cancer and sinus (4.41%) lung cancer, lymphoma and bone cancer (2.94%), both throat and buccal (5.88%) and other cancer (8.82%), respectively. The symptoms (pain, inflammation, burning sensation, difficulty in swallowing, irritation, etc.) of cancer patients were categorized into severe, moderateand mild categories, respectively. Intensive study of the data of cancer patients revealed that the degree of severe, moderate and mild symptoms were 82.16%, 15.8% and 1.58% on the first day and 7.9%, 55.3% and 36.34% on the eighth day, respectively. It was evaluated that patients who were receiving cow urine therapy since 2-3 months were most benefited. Hence, this traditional therapy may really a boon to cancer patients.\n\n\nA short, small study with little controls. As a first exploration this might do. For a \"medicine\" that is thousands of years old this will not do. The scientific quality of the evidence presented here is absolutely abysmal. And the quality of the publishing venues is not considered in this verdict.\n\nIn vitro studies might show interesting results, like Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Activities of Cow Urine and Cow Urine Concentrate: A potent agent with Antimicrobial and Anthelmintic activity. But in almost every case the authors state that they are rooted in the tradition and wanted to prove the value of a traditional treatment option.  They very often jump to conclusions that have no scientific or even logic basis: \"a boon to cancer patients\"?\n\nAs a traditional treatment option this juicy medicine might also be applied to treat eye/vision problems. Judging the efficacy with just the alternative medicine adage of \"who heals is right\" it has to be said that cow urine does not seem to help very much:\n\n\n  A total of 1420 new patients attended the eye clinic during the study period (January to December 2009). Forty eight (3.4%) applied various substances into their eyes after sustaining ocular injury. Substances applied include Kerosene 25%, cassava water 20.8%, breast milk 12.5%, personal urine 10.8%, and cow urine 8.3%. Nearly half of the patients 23 (47.9%) presented with low vision and after treatment there was no visual improvement in almost all of them, 22 (45.8%).\n  Prevalence of Harmful/Traditional Medication Use in Traumatic Eye Injury Glob J Health Sci. 2013 Jul; 5(4): 55\u201359.\n\n\nCow urine, or Gomutra has little scientific investigations really in its favour, but some quite heavily against it.\n\nIn rats:\n\n\n  Evaluation of antidiabetic, antioxidant effect and safety profile of gomutra ark in Wistar albino rats\n  The effect of Gomutra ark (GoA) on experimental alloxan-induced diabetes in rats was studied. For this purpose, Wistar albino rats of either sex weighing 200-250 g were used. The biochemical parameters like blood sugar, vitamin C, and malondialdehyde release were measured. The safety profile of GoA was evaluated using acute and chronic toxicity studies. GoA significantly lowers blood glucose in diabetic rats although the observed effect was found to be less than glibenclamide. It significantly lowers the level of malondialdehyde and vitamin C in diabetic rats. No toxicity was observed even when cow urine was given 32 times of the study dose in acute toxicity and no significant changes were seen when it was used chronically, which suggests that cow urine is having a very high therapeutic index. This study supports the traditional use of GoA in diabetes and is having a high therapeutic index and is safe for chronic use. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of Gomutra ark.\n\n\nBut the caveats that rats might be different from humans are not to be dismissed. Rats are apparently already different enough from dogs or mice:\n\n\n  DD Oyebola; RA Elegbe (1975). \"Cow's urine poisoning in Nigeria. Experimental observations in mice\". Tropical and geographical medicine. 27 (2): 194\u2013202.\n  The method of preparation and administration of \"cow's urine\" and the signs and symptoms of cow's urine poisoning have been described. Experimental investigations were carried out in mice to assess the toxicity ot this concoction. Effect of the preparation was compared with that of pure nicotine. The effect of each component used in preparing the concoction was also tested. Results of the experiments show that both \"cow's urine\" and nicotine cause excitement in low doses and cause convulsion and/or death in higher doses. Both also depress respiration. The role of \"cow's urine\" toxicity following administration to patients with convulsion and the possible aetiology of the neurological sequelae of \"cow's urine\" poisoning are discussed.\n\n\nThe most dangerous aspect found recently seems to lie in the danger of even catching a prion-disease via urine: A Protease-resistant Prion Protein Isoform is Present in Urine of Animals and Humans Affected with Prion Diseases (2001). \n\nWhile it might be that Western Medicine is a bit prejudiced or uninterested in this regard and just does not look into the matter properly, as long as only ayurvedic practitioners, esotericists and Hindu nationalists continue to claim any health benefits were associated with drinking traditional preparations of cow urine, the known dangers seem to outweigh the dubious claims of benefits.\n\nFrom a theoretical thought experiment perspective that this practice is said to be widely used in India, and India is neither leading in death from drinking cow urine nor leading in successful treatment of cancers: health benefits of drinking cow urine are unfounded.\n\nOr in the words of other experts as reported via abc-news:\n\n\n  Curing cancer with cow urine? Cancer prevention experts said this seems like an unlikely stretch.\n  \n  \"It's a claim from somebody that does not have any distinction or credentials, and it's an empty claim without scientific basis,\" said Dr. Sam Epstein, emeritus professor of environmental and occupational medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health.\n  \n  Dr. Donald Hensrud, chairman of the Division of Preventive Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., agreed. \"I think I'm perfectly comfortable in saying that I'm aware of no data that cow's urine \u2013\u2013 or any other species' urine \u2013\u2013 holds any promise ... in treating or preventing cancer.\"\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/41372#41377", "answerId": "41377"}

Another common theme is the use of suggestion or hypnosis.\n\nHypnosis is pseudoscience, so this claim is extraneous.  Published research is not usually difficult to find, so it ought to be easy enough to confirm such claims, and indeed, a fair amount of published case reports (mostly before 1950), studies, and reviews on such phenomenon exists in the literature.\n\nOne such review, by Orne &amp; Hammer (1974), in the 15th edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica summarizes:\n\n\n  There is controversy about the hypnotic induction of blisters. Told\n  that a cool coin touching him is red hot, a subject shows intense\n  discomfort; sometimes there may be redness and blistering skin.\n  Generally not reproducible under controlled laboratory conditions with\n  normal volunteer subjects, psychologically induced blisters seem most\n  likely to appear only in those prone to convert emotional disturbances\n  into symptoms of skin disease.\n\n\nFromm &amp; Shor (1972) (reprinted in Fromm &amp; Shor (2006)) provide a more thorough review in their book on Hypnosis:\n\n\n  During the past one hundred years, many researchers suggested to their\n  hypnotic trance subjects that a blister would form on the skin.  With\n  very few exceptions, no skin changes whatsoever were observed (Barber,\n  1969b, Ch. 9).  About twelve researchers reported that suggestions for\n  blister formation gave rise to cutaneous alterations; some of these\n  alterations were labeled \"blisters\".  These reports should be viewed\n  within a broader context ... delineated in a series of reviews\n  (Barber, 1961b; Gorton, 1949; Pattie, 1941; Paul, 1963; Sarbin, 1956;\n  Weitzenhogger, 1953).  With very few exceptions, the positive findings were obtained ... prior to the advent of rigorous experimental controls ... A study ... (Borelli, 1953) showed\n  conclusively that the skin change that was produced by suggestion was\n  dermographism, not a blister.\n\n\nA more recent review by Nash &amp; Barnier (2008), in their textbook on Hypnosis, comes to the same conclusion:\n\n\n  The formation of blisters has been reviewed by others (Gorton, 1957;\n  Paul, 1963; Johnson and Barber, 1976; Barber, 1978; Johnson, 1989;\n  Gauld, 1990), though there have been very few additional studies\n  conducted since Pattie's [1941] review.  Paul (1963) suggested that\n  one of the major limitations of a number of prior studies was the\n  failure to consider the possibility of blister formation resulting\n  from contact dermatitis. ... In summary, the notion that hypnotic\n  suggestion can produce blisters does not appear to be reliably\n  validated by controlled research.\n\n\nDermographism and contact dermatitis are allergic reactions to contact with materials.  In other words, contact with the items listed above can, in some percentage of the population, cause skin reactions that may superficially resemble blisters.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/35883#41097", "answerId": "41097"}

They put significant amounts of CO2, and more importantly, water vapor, directly where it has the most significant impact: High up in the atmosphere. And they are the only source doing that. When US air traffic was grounded for three days following 9/11, the effects were immediately measurable.(Ref. 3)\n\nCarbonIndependent.org Aviation sources elaborates in some detail on how its CO2 calculator does its calculation, arriving at 250 kg CO2e per flight hour (about the same value that the GEA calculator gives you -- 250kg/h * 22h = 5500kg ), then going on to quote Professor David Lee, Director, Centre for Air Transport and the Environment (CATE), Manchester Metropolitan University:\n\n\n  Whilst it is incorrect to multiply CO2 emissions by the RFI, it is clear from the foregoing that aviation's effects are more than that of CO2.

Nonetheless, it is clear that aviation imposes other effects on climate which are greater than that implied from simply considering its CO2 emissions alone.\n\n\nThe site then goes on to state (emphasis theirs, but especially note the last line):\n\n\n  According to this statement, it is incorrect to multiply CO2 emissions by the RFI, but it is also incorrect to ignore them. For the purposes of a calculator, some decision must be taken until further evidence is available, and the Carbon Independent calculator will for the time being multiply aviation CO2 emissions by a factor of 2.0. The practical consequences are in fact minor as regards informing people on the easiest way to reduce their carbon footprint; whatever the size of the factor used, the easiest way for most people who fly to reduce their carbon footprint will be to cut back on flying.\n\n\n\n\nSo, without going into actual number crunching and arguing about the \"correct\" CO2e calculation (which does not exist), the Environment Agency's calculation seem legit, and does correspond to the broad opinion in climate research.\n\n(1): http://www.geo.utexas.edu/courses/387H/PAPERS/kiehl.pdf\n\n(2): https://www.bpb.de/apuz/30101/klimawandel-einige-fakten\n\n(3): http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/artificial-weather-revealed-post-9-11-flight-groundings\n\n\n\nFurther references:\n\n\nIPCC, 1999: \"Aviation and the Global Atmosphere\"\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44255#44256", "answerId": "44256"}

We can see that this particular burger doesn't seem to be rotting, but is that unusual or unexpected?\n\nMorgan Spurlock, in the movie Super Size me conducted an experiment with a number of McDonald's burgers and burgers from other sources, placing them in glass jars.\n\nThe results were that all of the burgers were rotting after a few weeks. (Yes, they were at different rates, but larger samples sizes would be required to see if that was was significant, as well as controlling for more variables, like burger size.)\n\nAnother experiment was started here by Serious Eats.\n\nIt looked at a number of different questions:\n\n\n  \n  Whether it's something in the beef that's keeping the burgers from rotting.\n  Whether it's something in the bun that's keeping the burgers from rotting.\n  Whether it's some sort of magical alchemic reaction that keeps the burgers from rotting only when a  McDonald's patty is in contact with a McDonald's bun.\n  Whether it's the size of the patties that are preventing the burger from rotting.\n  Whether it's the storage environment that is preventing the burgers from rotting.\n  \n\n\nIn the conclusion, it found that burgers (McDonalds or home-made) stored in the open air, where they could dry out, had little or no mould. Burgers (McDonalds or home-made) stored in plastic bags that held in the moisture (like Spurlock's glass jars) got mouldy.\n\n\n  Pretty strong evidence in favor of Theory 3: the burger doesn't rot because it's small size and relatively large surface area help it to lose moisture very fast. Without moisture, there's no mold or bacterial growth. Of course, that the meat is pretty much sterile to begin with due to the high cooking temperature helps things along as well. It's not really surprising. Humans have known about this phenomenon for thousands of years. After all, how do you think beef jerky is made?\n\n\nSo, no, McDonald's burgers do not have an unnaturally long lifespan. They have a similar lifespan to other commercial and homemade burgers.

{"question": "Does radon gas significantly increase one's chances of getting lung cancer?", "questionId": "4621", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4621", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "It does indeed.\n\nTo start with, the Wikipedia page on radon is pretty great (it's rated a \"good article\").\n\nNow for facts: Radon was discovered to be a problem (woohoo, 1960's Time article) through studies of miners back in the 1950's, when just a few too many non-smoker miners started getting lung cancer. These were all uranium miners, and as radon is a direct byproduct of uranium decay, one thing led to another (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  To estimate the risk of lung cancer mortality among nonsmokers exposed to varying levels of radon daughters, 516 white men who never smoked cigarettes, pipes, or cigars were selected from the US Public Health Service cohort of Colorado Plateau uranium miners and followed up from 1950 through 1984. Age-specific mortality rates for nonsmokers from a study of US veterans were used for comparison. Fourteen deaths from lung cancer were observed among the nonsmoking miners, while 1.1 deaths were expected, yielding a standardized mortality ratio of 12.7 with 95% confidence limits of 8.0 and 20.1. These results confirm that exposure to radon daughters in the absence of cigarette smoking is a potent carcinogen that should be strictly controlled.\n\n\nAdam Davis' commented link to the National Cancer Institute is certainly informative, as are a few pages created by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (both links share a certain amount of information). The first (both, in fact) EPA link has a nice \"risks chart\" for smokers and non-smokers, showing the levels of radon exposure and the correlation to cancer occurrence. This chart will be better understood, though, if one knows something about measurement meanings (units are in this case, as in most cases when dealing with radiation, diverse and un-unified at best). Taken from the Wiki article above:\n\n\nRadon is often measured in picocuries per liter (pCi/L).\nThe more \"standard\" (read: SI) measurement is becquerels per cubic meter, where 1 pCi/L = 37 Bq/m3\nThe mining industry uses something entirely different, of course, called a working level (WL). Since this is where all the data initially came from, what we now use has been translated from it. But for consistency's sake, one month's worth of exposure to a WL, a working level month (WLM), is \"roughly equivalent to living one year in an atmosphere with a radon concentration of 230 Bq/m3.\"\n\n\nIt'll be even better understood once one knows that, from the second EPA article, \"The average radon concentration in the indoor air of America\u2019s homes is about 1.3 pCi/L\" (~48 Bq/m3). But some are going to be more, and it should absolutely be tested on a case by case basis (a figure the Wiki article claims in the Concentration Scale section is a universal rating of 100 Bq/m3 (2.7pCi/L) for a house, which is certainly higher than the EPA's recommended amount).\n\nTo wrap this up with some more modern statistics, take a look at the EPA fact sheet from a pooled study from 2005 (emphasis mine, extra parenthesis and spacing issues theirs):\n\n\n  Overall, the odds ratios for lung cancer increased with increasing radon exposure categories, with an odds ratio of 1.37 (0.98-1.92)) for concentrations exceeding 200 Bq/m3 [5.4 pCi/L] relative to concentrations under 25 Bq/m3 [.68 pCi/L].The overall estimate of the excess odds ratio for lung cancer per 100 Bq/m3 [2.7 pCi/L] was 11% (0%-28%).\n\n\nThat info appears to meld smokers and non-smokers, but that's fine. The standard claim (from almost all of the citations here) seems to be that about 21,000 Americans die every year from radon exposure, which is also a combined number (about 2,900 non-smokers, according to the second EPA page). One can quickly see that this 21,000 number is far less than 11% (which is good, especially since that's only the increased odds of getting cancer, not dying from it) - it's actually 0.007% of the overall population, or about 0.001% for non-smokers (given an American population of about 300 million). This shows that our houses, on average, are pretty good about having low radon levels. If we take the 1.3 pCi/L (48 Bq/m3) EPA estimate to be true, then we're at about half of the \"universal number.\"\n\nSo even if you're a smoker, radon isn't going to enormously change your risk of dying from cancer (unless you live in a particularly radioactive area), but there is a definite and defined increase, and you'll certainly be more likely to develop the disease. It's a very easy \"better safe than sorry\" call to make.\n\n(I apologize that all of this data primarily concerns the US and not the UK, but I'm sure this all holds roughly true anywhere in the world.)\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4621#4648", "answerId": "4648"}

They also released their own conclusions, which, ironically, don't match their own data.  However, an article released a couple weeks ago, Raw Milk Reality: Is Raw Milk Dangerous? attempts to examine the best numbers available from the CDC and other sources, and does its own analysis of the relative safety of raw milk compared to other foods, and specifically, pasteurized milk.\n\nAmong its findings:\n\n\nDairy products, categorically, are the safest of all food types, in terms of food-borne illness outbreaks\n2000 - 2007, there were 37 food-borne illness outbreaks related to raw liquid milk, affecting 800 people.

It shows that, for liquid milk consumption:\n\n\n1998 - 2009, there were 85 food-borne illness outbreaks related to raw liquid milk, affecting 1,495 people, including no deaths. Average outbreak size: 18 people\n1998 - 2009, there were 9 foud-borne illness outbreaks related to pasteurized liquid milk, affecting 2,200 people, including 3 deaths.  Average outbreak size: 244 people\n\n\nThe data from these two articles don't completely agree with each other. It's not clear where the discrepancy lies.  What seems clear from my research, though, is that there has not been a single confirmed raw-milk releated death in the U.S. since the 1980s, despite CDC claims to the contrary on their web site.  The CDC has even admitted their propaganda is wrong.\n\nTL;DR; / Conclusion:\n\nUsing the best data currently available, strictly from a food-borne illness standpoint, consuming raw milk carries roughly 9.4 times higher relative risk than consuming pasteurized milk. But in absolute terms, both risks are incredibly small, with raw milk carrying a 1/94,000 (0.001064%) chance of illness, and pasteurized milk carrying a 1/888,000 (0.000113%) chance of illness.\n\nFor many, the touted benefits of raw milk (more on that in my old answer below) are worth the added 0.000951% chance of food-borne illness.\n\nBut food-borne illness is not the only risk associated with liquid milk consumption. Some other possible risks which may favor raw milk, but which are much harder to quantify, are:\n\n\nPasteurized milk may contribute to many ailments, including lactose intolerance, allergies, asthma, frequent ear infections, gastro-Intestinal problems, diabetes, auto-Immune disease, attention deficit disorder and constipation (source).\nTraditional dairies in the U.S. use rBGH (which is illegal in many other countries). Consuming milk from rBGH-treated cows may increase the risk of certain cancers in humans, particularly breast and prostate cancer. (source)\nTraditional dairies, and in particular those which also use rBGH, often administer large amounts of antibiotics to their cows, which typically gets into the milk, exposing the human consumers to unnecessary antibiotics.  The risks of over-exposure to antibiotics is well documented.  The main concern is in making antibiotic-resistent \"superbug\" strains. (source).\n\n\nNote that the last two (rBGH and antibiotics) can also be avoided by purchasing organic pasteurized milk.\n\n\n\nMY OLD ANSWER; left for reference\n\nShort answer: No. In fact, pasteurized milk is often more dangerous than raw milk.\n\nLong answer: Of course, it depends.\n\nRaw milk is not inherently dangerous at all.  The reason for pasteurization is not because milk is, by nature, a dangerous product to consume.  Pasteurization is done for two basic reasons: 1) To kill any living contaminants, and 2) to extend shelf life.\n\nBecause pasteurization kills most bacteria (good and bad) contained in the milk, it won't go bad as quickly.  The down side to this is, when it does begin to sour, it goes rancid, and is no longer fit for human consumption.  On the other hand, when raw milk begins to sour, it isn't actually \"bad\" immediately, because the live cultures in milk prevent it from going rancid so quickly.  Many foods we take for granted are various forms of \"sour\" milk--Yogurt, Cheese, sour cream, etc.  And if you consume raw milk, and it begins to sour, you can still use it to make many of these milk products.\n\n\n  Fermentation starts digesting the milk protein casein, and digests some of the lactose. Souring of [raw] milk does not destroy any of milks beneficial properties.\n  \n  Treat a sample of pasteurized milk in the same way as above and putrefaction will make the milk unfit for human consumption. This is due to disease producing bacteria surviving the pasteurization process. (Emphasis in original)\n\n\nAnd paraphrasing an Anonymous dairy farmer:\n\n\n  Pasteurized milk gone bad will kill you - raw milk won't.....pasteurized milk rots.\n\n\nNow, the reason for pasteurizing milk is to kill harmful living organisms.  However, it also kills most of the beneficial living organisms in the milk as well.  This can, in some cases, actually lead pasteurized milk to be more dangerous than raw milk.\n\n\nPasteurized milk is harder to digest, especially for those who are lactose intolerant or with digestive disorders.\n\n\n  Today, milk is made even more indigestible by the universal practice of pasteurization, which destroys its natural enzymes and alters its delicate proteins. (source).\n\nPasteurized milk has less nutritional value. (source)\nPasteurized milk is less beneficial in boosting immune system function (source)\nPasteurized milk is more susceptible to contamination:\n\n\n  Due to high-volume distribution and its comparative lack of anti-microbial components, pasteurized milk when contaminated has caused numerous widespread and serious outbreaks of illness, including a 1984-5 outbreak afflicting almost 200,000 people.  In 2007, three people died in Massachusetts from illness caused by contaminated pasteurized milk (Real Milk PowerPoint, slide 30).\n\nRaw milk is useful in fighting infection, diarrhea, rickets, tooth decay, TB, asthma, allergies (source), diabetes1, Bright's disease, gastric disturbances, obesity, urinary problems, and kidney stones2\nPasteurized milk contributes to many ailments (ironcially, many of them are also found in the list that raw milk helps treat): lactose intolerance,  allergies, asthma, frequent ear infections, gastro-Intestinal problems, diabetes, auto-Immune disease, attention deficit disorder and constipation (source)\n\n\nThe reason pasteurization ever caught on as a practice, was to reduce the possibility for contamination in milk.  This may well have been (and may continue to be!) a valid concern, in some cases.  Although the evidence is shaky, at best.  The two possible sources of contamination are:\n\n\nContamination passed from cow to milk\n\nAs @Paula pointed out, there has been a concern that TB may pass from bovine to human.  This was considered a legitimate threat in 1882, when Dr. Robert Koch discovered that bovine and human varieties of TB were deemed similar. However, Koch later changed his opinion, saying that bovine TB could not spread to humans. The professional opinion has further been adjusted since then, and the current state of affairs on bovine/human TB contamination is essentially that:\n\n\n  [I]t appears obvious that we have arrived at a point in [the United States] when the dissemination of bovine tuberculosis is no longer a matter of serious concern. (source).\n\n\nIronically, raw milk is actually beneficial in fighting TB in humans. Real Milk PowerPoint, slides 54-56, 58.\nContamination from processing\n\nAt the time pasteurization was initiated, many (if not most) of the dairies in the U.S. (and much of Europe) were filthy, and sanitation was abysmal, leading to much contamination of milk during milking and bottling.  Since the invention of closed-system milking machines in the 1940s, it is possible to eliminate the most serious exposure to external contamination.\n\n\nOther factors affect the relative safety of raw vs. pasteurized milk as well.  This site describes how a cow's diet has a strong impact on the pathogen-fighting ability of the milk produced, and as such, milk from cows fed diets heavy in heavy in grain, soybeans and cottonseed meal (common in many commercial dairy operations) must be pasteurized to be safe.\n\nOn the measured safety of raw milk:\n\n\nFound here:\n\n\n  Based on data in a 2003 USDA/FDA report: Compared to raw milk there are 515 times more illnesses from L-mono due to deli meats and 29 times more illness from L-mono due to pasteurized milk. On a PER-SERVING BASIS, deli meats were TEN times more likely than raw milk to cause illness (Intrepretive Summary \u2013 Listeria Monocytogenes Risk Assessment, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Sept. 2003, page 17). (Emphasis mine)\n\nThis 132-page report examines the various scientific studies that supposedly cast a shadow over raw milk, and tries to interpret them with less (supposed) bias.  The following table is taken from page 6, and shows the results of examining 70 studies purported to show the dangers of raw milk, and the various flaws in many of the reports. The paper goes on to address each of the 70 studies point-by-point.\n\n\n\nAmong the findings of this report are that much of the evidence cited in the BJM article mentioned in @matt_black's answer, was flawed. Specifically, those that are mentioned in both papers:\n\n\nBJM Ref 1, Review p.80 - Milk-bourne illness outbreak in Scottland likely would not have been averted by pasteurization\nBJM ref 8, Review p.43 - Testing found no contamination in the raw milk supply\nBJM ref 10, Review p.41 - Contaminated raw milk was discovered, but not in milk intended for sale as raw milk.\nBJM ref 12,18, Review p.42 - \"This is a review rather than a primary reference.\" and \"There are no outbreaks mentioned in this review that could be said to be\nconclusively linked to unpasteurized milk, and in most cases the suspected milk was\nintended for pasteurization.\"\n\n100% of the studies cited by the FDA to implicate raw milk were fatally flawed, and failed to show raw milk is dangerous. (Response to the FDA, p. ii)\nBetween 1980 and 2005, the CDC attributed 19,531 illness cases to pasteurized milk and milk products, 10.7 times more than to raw milk. From this we cannot determine if raw milk is safer than pasteurized, in part because there are no accurate estimates of raw milk consumers. ([Response to the FDA, p. ii)\nBetween 1998 and 2005, raw milk was associated with 0.4% of CDC-documented food-borne illnesses, including 831 illnesses, 66 hospitalizations, and a single death. (Response to the FDA, p. iii,5) Clearly raw milk is not \"perfectly safe,\" but neither is any other food.\n\n\nIn conclusion, if you can find a clean source of raw milk from healthy, well-fed cows, it is probably safer than the pasteurized milk you can find at the supermarket.  On the other hand, if your raw milk is unsafely handled, or comes from unhealthy cows, it may be harmful.  But that's really just common sense--we all want to eat clean food, right?

{"question": "Can gamma rays on an airplane damage a digital camera?", "questionId": "40347", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40347", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "Robert Hummel's claims are quite inaccurate, in a number of ways.\n\nThe gamma ray flux on Earth\n\nEarth's atmosphere is effectively opaque to gamma rays and cosmic rays, the latter of which are high-energy protons or the ionized nuclei of other elements. Gamma rays - in particular high energy gamma rays - are emitted by objects like active galaxies, pulsar wind nebulae, and gamma ray burst progenitors. They create a spectrum that can be roughly described as a two-part broken power law that decreases with increasing energy.\n\nThe vast majority of gamma rays that reach Earth collide with particles in Earth's atmosphere at altitudes of 20-30 km (see Ozlem Celik's PhD thesis), 3-5 times as high as the altitudes Hummer is referring to. They create electron-positron pairs, which then lose energy through a mechanism called bremsstrahlung, in turn emitting more photons, which create more electron-positron pairs. This is what we call an air shower, and even though (optical) radiation from these particles will eventually reach Earth's surface, large amounts of it will be dissipated (Abeysekara et al. 2017). Even the air shower from a 1 TeV gamma ray will lose ~93% of its energy by the time it hits the ground, and at 20,000 feet, the remaining energy should still be significantly small.\n\nTo quantify this a bit more, we can say that the atmosphere has a thickness of 1000 grams per square centimeter, or about 28 radiation lengths (Funk 2015; arXiv version). The radiation length is the distance over which the gamma ray flux decreases by a factor of 1/e; it is roughly 37.7 grams per square centimeter (see Celik). (Side note: Funk says that Earth's atmosphere is equivalent to about 1 meter of lead, which means that Hummer's claim of 125 meters of concrete shielding is a little unlikely, as the gamma ray flux through that much material would seem to be quite close to zero.)\n\nWe can convert an altitude to radiation lengths by linearly integrating the density of air to a given altitude. At 13,000 feet, the atmosphere has a depth of 16.7 radiation lengths; at 36,000 feet, this is 6.1 radiation lengths. At 20,000 feet, somewhere in the middle (~12) seems reasonable, meaning that a camera at 20,000 feet will receive e28-12 = e16 = 8.8 million times as much radiation (roughly) as a camera on the ground.\n\nHow much is needed to damage a camera?\n\nNot surprisingly, scientists care about how much damage instruments suffer from radiation, including gamma rays and cosmic rays. It turns out that the performance of a high-resolution (AVT Marlin F-145C2) camera degrades at exposures of about 100 milliSieverts per hour of low-energy (100 keV - 1.5 MeV) gamma rays (Marbs &amp; Boochs 2006).\n\nNow, Earth does receive higher energy gamma rays - for instance, we see particularly interesting high-energy (TeV and, rarely, PeV) emission from various galactic and extragalactic sources. However, both the cosmic ray and gamma ray spectra follow a sharply decreasing double broken power law with increasing energy. Here, for instance, is the cosmic ray spectrum incident on Earth's atmosphere, from 1 GeV up (image credit: IceCube):\n\n\n\nAt 100 MeV, this may mean rates as high as 100 particles per square meter per second. However, after the attenuation of the Earth's atmosphere, this flux drops substantially, as we showed before. Go up by an order of magnitude in energy and your particle flux drops off by a factor of 100 or so, meaning the contribution of high-energy gamma rays is not substantial. I would argue that the analysis of the authors is applicable to the high-energy portion of the spectrum, too, simply because a camera at 20,000 feet will not be exposed to many high-energy particles on a flight of a few hours.\n\nAt even 10,000 feet, a human is exposed to about 5 microSieverts per hour; a camera would presumably be exposed to even less. Even 5 microSieverts per hour, however, is substantially smaller than the threshold given by Marbs &amp; Boochs. Moreover, if I wanted to be nitpicky, this figure includes cosmic rays, not just gamma rays; the gamma ray contribution would be much smaller.\n\nI think we can definitively say that no, gamma rays on an airplane will not damage a digital camera. In outer space, without the protection of Earth's atmosphere? Yes, both cameras and film can be quite easily damaged by cosmic rays and gamma rays.\n\nFor context, I'm currently doing work in ground-based gamma-ray astronomy as part of the VERITAS group.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40347#44209", "answerId": "44209"}

For example it is estimated that a human contains about ten times as many bacterial cells as there are human cells. I'd be extremely surprised if that wasn't also true for other animals.\n\nSo why worry about cleanliness then? Chicken meat can carry disease-causing bacteria, including salmonella, which infects chicken as well as humans. In addition, there are plenty of problematic bacteria in feces (E.coli comes to mind), and if the chicken aren't reared in very good hygienic condition, it is possible that contamination happens during the slaughter.\n\nNote that if you handle chicken meat properly - don't undercook the meat, don't lick your fingers after touching the meat, don't re-use the knife to spread peanut butter without washing it first etc -, the chances of infecting yourself with salmonella or other bacteria is very low.\n\nA farmer rearing a small number of chickens and taking good care of them will have an easier time spotting an infected chicken, and manual slaughtering/defeathering chickens is less likely to lead to contamination of meat with feces (depending, of course, on where you do it. In the open air next to a pile of cow dung is not ideal). Feed has not much do do with this, though, as long as the chicken don't eat their own feces.\n\nAs to the chlorine bath: Yes, that is apparently true.

Using logistic regression they say that\n\n\n  Our data suggest that there is a positive association between grit and student success in introductory programming courses (\u03b2\n  = 2.332, p = .002). That is, grittier students earn higher grades. This result provides an affirmative answer to the first\n  research question -- grit does predict student performance in high failure-rate courses as it does in low-failure rate ones.\n  \n  The results on the influence of ACT were mixed. Though the correlation matrix shows an insignificant link between ACT\n  and grades in introductory programming courses, the relationship is statistically significant in the regression analysis (\u03b2 =\n  0.256, p = .028). However, ACT score, as a proxy of student intelligence, has much less influence on course grade than grit.\n  Thus, the answer to our second research question is also affirmative \u2013 grit is a more powerful predictor of course grade than\n  student intelligence.\n\n\nSo if I'm allowed a bit of pun here, Spolsky's \"smart and gets things done\" is more of a case \"damn persistent and somewhat smart\", at least at this introductory programming level.\n\nAlso, it's interesting that although grit supposedly predicts [other] school grades, high-school grade-point-average could not predict success in CS1:\n\n\n  Data also shows that high-school GPA (HSgpa) did not significantly predict grade (OR = 1.448, \u03b2 = 0.370, p = .650).\n\n\n\n\nAnd on a more general note, there's one recent (2016) meta-analysis, which notes in its abstract:\n\n\n  Our results\n  based on 584 effect sizes from 88 independent samples representing 66,807 individuals indicate that the\n  higher order structure of grit is not confirmed, that grit is only moderately correlated with performance\n  and retention, and that grit is very strongly correlated with conscientiousness. We also find that the\n  perseverance of effort facet has significantly stronger criterion validities than the consistency of interest\n  facet and that perseverance of effort explains variance in academic performance even after controlling for\n  conscientiousness. In aggregate our results suggest that interventions designed to enhance grit may only\n  have weak effects on performance and success, that the construct validity of grit is in question, and that\n  the primary utility of the grit construct may lie in the perseverance facet.\n\n\nI have yet to read the whole paper, but (amusingly) the way I found this was wondering/googling whether I should have added \"passion\" to my Spolsky-like take on the CS1 predictors. But from this meta-analysis, apparently it's not that important... for the way grit is measured by current psychometric tests, such as Grit-8; just browsing the questions there, only one of the strikes me as being obviously about passion; in the rest of the questions I guess it was hoped it would be implicit/correlated, but from the meta-analysis it seems that's not the case much, so as currently measured grit is mostly \"perseverance of effort\", which I'd rather call persistence or tenacity.\n\nI should add that Duckworth has responded to this meta-analysis... on NPR.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40044#40221", "answerId": "40221"}

Blue, on the other hand, has been identified as calm, cool, and positive. Two laboratory experiments were conducted. In both experiments, retail environments were simulated using predominately red or blue colors. Both experiments corroborate the differential effects of red and blue that prior research suggested. Specifically, more positive retail outcomes occurred in blue rather than red environments. More simulated purchases, fewer purchase postponements, and a stronger inclination to shop and browse were found in blue retail environments. The second experiment helps to identify a plausible explanation to color effects. The results indicate that the affective perception of color rather than the arousal dimension of color may be responsible for the outcome. The positive effects of blue and the negative perception of red may have influenced the results.\n\nStore atmosphere and purchasing behavior.

These sot or changes (increases) in extreme weather are indeed discussed in the IPCC reports.  See e.g. chapter 11 of the IPCC AR4 WG1 report.\n\n\n  Extremes: There has been a large increase in the available analyses of\n  changes in extremes. This allows for a more comprehensive assessment\n  for most regions. The general findings are in line with the assessment\n  made in TAR and now have a higher level of confidence derived from\n  multiple sources of information. The most notable improvements in\n  confidence relate to the regional statements concerning heat waves,\n  heavy precipitation and droughts. Despite these advances, specific\n  analyses of models are not available for some regions, which is\n  reflected in the robust statements on extremes. In particular,\n  projections concerning extreme events in the tropics remain uncertain.\n  The difficulty in projecting the distribution of tropical cyclones\n  adds to this uncertainty. Changes in extra-tropical cyclones are\n  dependent on details of regional atmospheric circulation response,\n  some of which remain uncertain.\n\n\nCompare this with straw man \"one side claims all data and predictions are perfectly without fault\" (c.f. comment by the OP above).  Note that even here in the summary, the IPCC are being very careful to state defficiencies in the modelling work available and the uncertainties.  I strongly recommend people obtain a copy of the IPCC report and read that, rather than climate skeptic blogs.\n\nAs to polar vortex, the models do predict there will be changes in its behaviour as a result of climate change:\n\n\n  Interannual variability over North America is connected to two\n  large-scale oscillation patterns (see Chapter 3), ENSO and the NAO/AO.\n  The MMD model projections indicate an intensification of the polar vortex and many models project a decrease in the arctic surface\n  pressure, which contributes to an increase in the AO/NAO index; the\n  uncertainty is large, however, due to the diverse responses of AOGCMs\n  in simulating the Aleutian Low (Chapter 10). The MMD model projections\n  indicate a shift towards mean El-Nin\u0303o like conditions, with the\n  eastern Pacific warming more than the western Pacific; there is a wide\n  range of behaviour among the current models, with no clear indication\n  of possible changes in the amplitude or period of El Nin\u0303o (Chapter\n  10).\n\n\nAgain, unlike the climate change dissenters' caricature of the debate, note the clear statement of the uncertainties.  \n\nFrom the most recent AR5 WGI report\n\n\n  Anthropogenic climate change may also bring systematic cold-season\n  precipitation changes. As with previous models, CMIP5 projections\n  generally agree in projecting a winter precipitation increase over the\n  northern half of NA (Figure 14.18 and AI.19). This is associated with\n  increased atmospheric moisture, increased moisture convergence, and a\n  poleward shift in ETC activity (Section 14.6.2 and Table 14.3). The\n  change is consistent with CMIP3 model projections of positive NAO\n  trends (Table 14.3; Hori et al., 2007; Karpechko, 2010; Zhu and Wang,\n  2010). Winter precipitation increases extend southward into the USA\n  (northern portions of SREX regions 3 to 5; Neelin et al., 2013) but\n  with decreasing strength relative to natural variability. This\n  behaviour is qualitatively reproduced in higher resolution simulations\n  (Figure\n  14.18).\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22361#22365", "answerId": "22365"}

Brown, Recent Advances in Animal Nutrition \u2013 Australia 17 (2009))\n\n\n  Summary\n  \n  Many dog owners wish to feed their dogs a vegetarian\n  diet for the same ethical reason that they themselves are\n  vegetarian. To meet this demand, there are an increasing\n  number of vegetarian diets and recipes available for\n  dogs. However, proof for their claims of nutritional\n  adequacy is often lacking. There is little doubt that a\n  dog\u2019s nutritional requirements can be met from a diet that\n  does not contain meat; however, the difference between\n  the amino acid profiles of plant and animal proteins\n  must be considered. It has been shown that exercising\n  dogs may develop anaemia when fed unbalanced plantprotein\n  diets but will remain in good health if the meatfree\n  diet is correctly balanced. Many plant ingredients\n  contain high levels of non-starch polysaccharides and\n  other anti-nutritive factors, which may reduce the\n  availability of some nutrients. A diet devoid of animal\n  ingredients is also likely to be of low palatability to\n  dogs. All diets should be correctly formulated to meet\n  nutrient requirements based on chemical analysis and\n  predicted or measured apparent digestibility, should be\n  sufficiently palatable to ensure adequate dietary intake\n  and should maintain good health when consumed. If\n  a vegetarian diet meets all of these criteria, then it is\n  a suitable diet for the dog, irrespective of the owner\u2019s\n  motivation for feeding a vegetarian diet.\n  \n  Conclusions\n  \n  The nutritional adequacy of a diet, vegetarian or\n  otherwise, should be based on the ability of the diet\n  to meet nutritional requirements. Palatability and\n  digestibility are key considerations. A large number of\n  dogs are currently fed meat-free diets, and there is a\n  small but growing niche market for vegetarian pet foods.\n  The major pet food manufacturers are unlikely to enter\n  this market until there is greater acceptance of this type\n  of product. Should this eventuate, it is hoped that their\n  participation will ensure that the nutritional adequacy\n  of commercial vegetarian dog foods is validated by\n  recognised feeding protocols and digestibility trials.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20645#26827", "answerId": "26827"}

{"question": "Does having more women in a group increase its collective intelligence?", "questionId": "38033", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/38033", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "I was going to edit my question to make some clarifications on the question. which in retrospect could, perhaps, have been more focused, in particular with respect to the notion of \"collective intelligence\". But then I realised that it would be better suited as an answer.\n\n\n\nFirst let's look at how the cited paper discussed \"collective intelligence\":\n\n\n  Even though social psychologists have studied for decades how well groups perform specific tasks, they have not attempted to measure group intelligence in the same way individual intelligence is measured\u2014by assessing how well a single group can perform a wide range of different tasks and using that information to predict how that same group will perform other tasks in the future. [...] By analogy with individual intelligence, we\n  define a group\u2019s collective intelligence (c) as the\n  general ability of the group to perform a wide\n  variety of tasks. Empirically, collective intelligence\n  is the inference one draws when the ability of a\n  group to perform one task is correlated with that\n  group\u2019s ability to perform a wide range of other\n  tasks. This kind of collective intelligence is a property\n  of the group itself, not just the individuals in it.\n\n\nHere's the experiments:\n\n\n  In Study 1, 40 three-person groups worked together for up to 5 hours on a diverse set of simple group tasks plus a more complex criterion task. To guide our task sampling, we drew tasks from all quadrants of the McGrath Task Circumplex, a well-established taxonomy of group tasks based on the coordination processes they require. Tasks included solving visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. At the beginning of each session, we measured team members\u2019 individual intelligence. And, as a criterion task at the end of each session, each group played checkers against a standardized computer opponent.\n\n\nThe quadrant refers to the following four items of collaboration:\n\n\nGenerating ideas or plans\nChoosing a solution\nNegotiating a solution to a conflict\nExecuting a task\n\n\nThe link between the tasks used in the first study and these quadrants is not specified in much detail, nor could I find details on how performance on the tasks was evaluated. \n\nThe paper also performed a second study with 152 groups ranging from two to five members. A subset of these groups (of unspecified size) worked on an additional five tasks, numbering ten in total.\n\nSummarising the main results:\n\n\n  If c exists, what causes it? Combining the findings of the two studies, the average intelligence of individual group members was moderately correlated with c (r = 0.15, P = 0.04), and so was the intelligence of the highest-scoring team member (r = 0.19, P = 0.008). However, for both studies, c was still a much better predictor of group performance on the criterion tasks than the average or maximum individual intelligence.\n  \n  We also examined a number of group and individual factors that might be good predictors of c. We found that many of the factors one might have expected to predict group performance\u2014such as group cohesion, motivation, and satisfaction\u2014did not.\n  \n  However, three factors were significantly correlated with c. First, there was a significant correlation between c and the average social sensitivity of group members, as measured by the \u201cReading the Mind in the Eyes\u201d test (15) (r = 0.26, P = 0.002). Second, c was negatively correlated with the variance in the number of speaking turns by group members, as measured by the sociometric badges worn by a subset of the groups (16) (r = \u20130.41, P = 0.01). In other words, groups where a few people dominated the conversation were less collectively intelligent than those with a more equal distribution of conversational turn-taking. \n  \n  Finally, c was positively and significantly correlated with the proportion of females in the group (r = 0.23, P = 0.007). However, this result appears to be largely mediated by social sensitivity (Sobelz = 1.93, P = 0.03), because (consistent with previous research) women in our sample scored better on the social sensitivity measure than men [t(441) = 3.42, P = 0.001]. In a regression analysis with the groups for which all three variables (social sensitivity, speaking turn variance, and percent female) were available, all had similar predictive power for c, although only social sensitivity reached statistical significance (b = 0.33, P = 0.05).\n\n\nSo those are some highlights from the paper the claims are based on. I would say aspects of the paper are vague and some language is potentially misleading (particularly \"collective intelligence\"), but I find no reason to doubt the information given.\n\n\n\nWith respect to the claims made by some of the mainstream media based on this paper, I'll just focus on the claims made by one source in particular since other sources make similar types of claims. (I just chose the first source rather than selecting one based on content.)\n\nHuffington Post: The Collective Intelligence of Women Could Save the World\n\n\n  Today\u2019s greatest existential risks stem from advanced technologies like nuclear weapons, biotechnology, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and even artificial superintelligence. These tools could trigger a disaster of unprecedented proportions. ... The good news is that none of these existential threats are inevitable. Humanity can overcome every single known danger. But accomplishing this will require the smartest groups working together for the common good of human survival. So, how do we ensure that we have the smartest groups working to solve the problem? Get women involved.\n\n\nIt is not clear how this conclusion can be drawn from the paper cited. There is only a speculative relation between the types of tasks defined for the \"smartest groups\" here (ability to face up to the mentioned \"existential tasks\") and the types of tasks used in the studies of the paper.\n\n(But probably there are common-sense arguments for why the claim is true in that you want to draw from the broadest talent-pool possible, which should of course include women.)\n\n\n  Most of us are familiar with general human intelligence, which describes a person\u2019s intelligence level across a broad spectrum of cognitive tasks. It turns out groups also have a similar \u201ccollective\u201d intelligence that determines how successfully they can navigate these cognitive tasks.\n\n\nThis is misleading as (in particular) the phrase \"these cognitive tasks\" draws a false equivalence between the tasks used to measure individual intelligence and those used to measure \"collective intelligence\" in the paper. One (arguably two) on the original five collective tasks in the paper relate to traditional intelligence assessment techniques: visual puzzles (and arguably playing checkers). Other tasks\u2014brainstorming, making moral judgments, and negotiation\u2014have only a tenuous link with standard individual intelligence assessment.\n\n\n  This leads to the second unexpected discovery. Intuitively, one might think that groups with really smart members will themselves be really smart. This is not the case. The researchers found no strong correlation between the average intelligence of members and the collective intelligence of the group. Similarly, one might suspect that the group\u2019s IQ will increase if a member of the group has a particularly high IQ. Surely a group with Noam Chomsky will perform better than one in which he\u2019s replaced by Joe Schmo. But again, the study found no strong correlation between the smartest person in the group and the group\u2019s collective smarts.\n\n\nThe study found a significant positive correlation between average individual intelligence (r = 0.15, P = 0.04) and \"collective intelligence\" and maximum individual intelligence (r = 0.19, P = 0.008) and \"collective intelligence\". Whether these count as \"strong correlations\", probably they do not. At the same time, the more problematic issue is the misleading representation of collective intelligence as indicating \"smartness in groups\". In some sense, the indirect language is getting more and more tenuous and further and further away from what the studies can actually tell us.\n\n\n  The last factor relates to the number of female members: the more women in the group, the higher the group\u2019s IQ. As the authors of the study explained, \u201cc was positively and significantly correlated with the proportion of females in the group.\u201d \n\n\nThe phrase \"group IQ\" is problematic.\n\nEverything else is fine, but it's worth noting that the correlation with respect to ratio of females was (r = 0.23, P = 0.007). Earlier, the correlation with respect to most intelligent member (r = 0.19, P = 0.008) was dismissed as \"not a strong correlation\". Granted the latter correlation is lower, but with a range of [\u22121,1], the difference between both correlations over the range of possible values is 2%. More importantly, it seems misleading to dismiss one correlation as not strong and herald the other as \"positively and significantly correlated\" even when that latter description applies equally to both.\n\n\n  If you find this surprising, you\u2019re not alone: the authors themselves didn\u2019t anticipate it, nor were they looking for a gender effect.\n\n\nThis is perhaps interesting in that the paper does not give details on the selection of members of groups, nor the relative gender balances and so forth. The gender issue was left rather as a postscript, but became the main talking point in the press.\n\n\n\nSummary: The article on which the claims are based is quite vague on a lot of seemingly important details, such as how people were assigned to groups; the relative number of men and women from the general population sampled; how tasks such as \"brainstorming\", \"making collective moral judgments\", \"negotiating over limited resources\" were evaluated; the additional five tasks assigned in the second study, etc. Also the figure quoted in the OP tends to suggest that the trend is not clear-cut.\n\nWith respect to the media, the notion of collective intelligence proposed and evaluated in the paper has only a tenuous link with the context in which it is described in the cited articles. Many such articles put it forward as a sort of \"group IQ\" but the majority of tasks used in the study have only a tenuous relation with IQ. In general, the articles relegate the importance of individual intelligence in such groups while promoting the importance of having more women; even generously allowing \"collective intelligence\" as a proxy of \"group IQ\", both correlations were positive and significant and quite close\u2014both variables had a similar effect. \n\n\n\nPersonal interpretation: In general, these articles promote the idea that groups with a higher ratio of women are naturally \"smarter\", that individual intelligence does not matter, and that this has been demonstrated scientifically. However, they sit on the politically correct interpretation of the principle they suggest to have scientific backing.

That CO2 emission is equivalent to 14 cars according to the EPA estimate of 4.6 metric tons / year, much less than 6000 cars.\n\nBut this is purely on the basis of CO2.

{"question": "Is there a relationship between yellow and moods?", "questionId": "7505", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7505", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Color theorists suspect that many color associations emerge from evolutionary ingrained responses to color stimuli (Mollon, 1989 http://jeb.biologists.org/content/146/1/21.full.pdf). Research indicates that colors often serve a signal function for nonhuman animals (e.g., the redness of fruit signals readiness for eating), thereby facilitating fitness-relevant behavior (Hutchings, J. (1997). Color in plants, animals, and man. In K. Nassau\n(Ed.), Color for Science, Art, and Technology (pp. 222\u2013246). Amsterdam:\nElsevier). Of the existing research that is theoretically based, most has been loosely guided by Goldstein\u2019s 1942 (http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;UID=1942-04745-001) proposal that red and yellow are naturally experienced as stimulating and disagreeable, that these colors focus people on the outward environment, and that they produce forceful, expansive behavior, whereas green and blue are experienced as quieting and agreeable, focus people inward, and produce reserved, stable behavior. Subsequent researchers have tended to interpret Goldstein\u2019s proposal in terms of wavelength and arousal: Longer-wavelength colors like red/orange are experienced as arousing, and shorter-wavelength colors like green/blue are experienced as calming.\n\nExperiments demonstrated that the perception of red prior to an achievement\ntask impairs performance relative to the perception of green or an achromatic color. This effect was documented in two different countries (the United States and Germany), with two different age groups (high school and undergraduate), in two different experimental settings (laboratory and classroom), using two different types of color presentation (participant number and test cover), using four different variants of red and green hues, using all three achromatic colors (black, white, and gray), and using both language-based and number-based achievement tasks. Evidence from funnel debriefing data, self-report process data, and perceived competence data supports premise that this undermining\neffect of red takes place outside of individuals\u2019 conscious awareness. These experiments also demonstrated that the perception of red prior to an achievement task, relative to the perception of green or an achromatic color, indeed evokes avoidance motivation, as indicated by participants\u2019 choice of easy relative to difficult tasks. The present findings represent the first demonstration of a\ndirect, replicable effect of color on performance using rigorous experimental methods. This research was explicitly designed to address weaknesses, and (a) use of tightly controlled color presentations, (b) use of colors perceived to\nbe typical and matched on saturation and brightness, and (c) adherence to basic methodological considerations (such as keeping the experimenter blind to the hypotheses and color conditions) allowed to clearly and emphatically document a relation between a relation between red and performance (http://www.psych.rochester.edu/people/elliot_andrew/assets/pdf/2007_ElliotMaierMollerFriedmanMeinhardt_Color.pdf)\n\nColor discrimination is the measurement of how well an observer can\ndifferentiate between colors. It is understood that human color vision demonstrates variability both within an individual observer (inter-observer) and from observer to observer (intra-observer) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15811001). \n\nThese variabilities demonstrated by the human visual system can be broken down into two primary categories, color vision deficiency and normal color vision.  The tests developed to quantify the ability of color discrimination include the Colorcurve HVC Color Vision Skill test and the Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue test. Research using these tests indicate that large variances of the colors red and yellow are noticed (more than normal variance given by the test guidelines). However, per the paper more experiment data is needed to confirm these\nfindings. (http://www.cis.rit.edu/research/mcsl2/research/PDFs/ColorCurve.pdf). \n\nResults from another study titled Differential binding of colors to objects in memory: red and yellow stick better than blue and green\nindicate that feature binding in memory is not a uniform process by which any attended feature is automatically bound into unitary memory representations. Rather, memory binding seems to vary across different subtypes of features, a finding that supports recent research showing that object features are stored in memory rather independently from each other (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4347302/).\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7505#28084", "answerId": "28084"}

However, honey is susceptible to physical and chemical changes during storage; it tends to darken and lose its aroma and flavor or crystallize. These are temperature-dependent processes, making the shelf life of honey difficult to define. For practical purposes, a shelf life of two years is often stated.

This is called hydrogen bonding and is a form of permanent dipole/permanent dipole interaction. Oxygen is more electronegative (its nucleus attracts a bigger share of the electron cloud of the covalent bond) than hydrogen. This causes water to form a permanent dipole where the oxygen has a small negative charge and the hydrogens have small positive charges. \n\nFile:Hydrogen-bonding-in-water-2D.png\n\nThis causes electrostatic attraction between water molecules and they can form structures for a small amount of time. Other molecules in the water can affect these short lived structures and water does retain some 'memory' of these molecules.\n\nThis is how some proponents of homeopathy claim it works. This memory somehow has an opposite effect to the toxin or other chemical that was diluted, although there has not been any mechanism proposed for this.\n\nHowever, the duration of the water memory has been scientifically tested and shown to be very short (less than one billionth of a second).

Now, we have overflowing cities and less food in them. This was known at the time, I remember about 2007-2008 there was talk about this possibly causing discord in Syria, which us Israelis take seriously, especially as it was only shortly after our 2006 problems with Lebanon. Sure enough, war in Syria broke out. Now, the \"real spark\" of the violence was in Daara a few years later due to political oppression, but things had been simmering for years and during that time the drought did not abide by much.\n\nDid climate change cause the drought? This is looking more and more certain. Did the drought move people into the cities? Yes. Did the drought mean that less food was available? Yes. Did less food and crowded cities mean that people were more willing to oppose their oppressors? That might be a long stretch, but it's plausible.\n\nBy the way, the current war in Syria has nothing to do with the war that started in Daara. But it was an evolution, I personally place the border between the two stages of the conflict when the Libyans started going to Syria to fight.\n\nIn short, climate change did not cause the war, but it was a major factor in setting up the pretext for war. The other major factors include government oppression (the start of conflict) and displaced Libyans who could not continue fighting in Libya (the current conflict).

Two medicines that may be effective in treating male-pattern baldness are finasteride and minoxidil. Minoxidil is currently the only medicine available to treat female-pattern baldness.\n\nPer Finner AM in 2013, \"a caloric deprivation or deficiency of several components such as proteins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and vitamins, caused by inborn errors or reduced uptake, can lead to structural abnormalities, pigmentation changes, or hair loss, although exact data is often lacking. The diagnosis for hair loss can be established through a careful history, clinical examination of hair loss activity, hair quality and confirmed through targeted laboratory tests. Examples of genetic hair disorders caused by reduced nutritional components are zinc deficiency in acrodermatitis enteropathica and copper deficiency in Menkes kinky hair syndrome.\" \n\nPer Perihan Ozturk in 2014, \"Copper deficiency as well as the deficiency of zinc, is known to be responsible for the etiology of hair loss and some other skin diseases, however there has been no study supporting this finding so far.

Based on the results of our study and others, the most important factors would appear to be the genetically-determined sensitivity of the follicles to DHT and their different reactions to androgen concentration.\n\n\nPer Ralph M Tru\u0308eb in 2009, \"experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays a major role in the ageing process and in contrast to topical minoxidil and oral finasteride in the management of androgenetic alopecia, topical melatonin is still being studied to represent the first topical 'antiaging' product for treatment of the ageing scalp.\"\n\n\n  Penetration and bioavailability studies (unpublished data) have so far been done in the forefront of a pilot study by Fischer et al suggesting that topically applied melatonin might influence human hair growth in vivo.\n\n\nPer NHS, there is some evidence that a diet very low in iron may be linked with hair loss but in general, hair loss is unlikely to be caused by a bad diet and there\u2019s no evidence that certain types of food boost hair growth or cause hair loss. Per Rushton DH in 2002, \"excessive intakes of nutritional supplements may actually cause hair loss and are not recommended in the absence of a proven deficiency.

Goodenaugh, and Dr. Kate Gordon - published a study \"of the most eminent men and women\" who had lived between 1450 and 1850 to estimate what their IQs might have been. The resultant IQs were based largely on the degrees of brightness and intelligence each subject showed before attaining the age of 17.\n  \n  Cox also found that different fields have quite widely varying average IQs for their acknowledged leading geniuses. Displayed below are there calculated Deviation IQs (the number in brackets is the number in the sample considered):\n  \n  Philosophers (22) average IQ 160; Scientists (39) 159; Fiction writers (53) 152; Statesmen (43) 150; Musicians (11) 149; Artists (13) 153; Soldiers (27) 136. \n\n\nSource: Ulf Norlinger.

{"question": "Does black magic work?", "questionId": "3331", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3331", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "\"Black magic\" is a really large umbrella for a wide range of claims, but the very definition of any \"magic\" is that it is somehow supernatural. Naturally (!), no compelling evidence has ever been put forth for any supernatural phenomenon. Once a phenomenon is observable, reproducible, and testable, and shown to exist, it may turn out to violate our current understanding of the natural laws, but if the phenomenon is for real, we shall have to adjust our views to accommodate this, and the phenomenon shall cease to be considered supernatural. \"Magic\" will never be shown to exist.\n\nAll rigorously tested supernatural claims have turned out to be fake, and the great number of untested supernatural claims can most likely be largely attributed to the fact that the practitioners are aware of their fraud, and reluctant to be exposed; see the million dollar challenge in Regebro's answer.\n\nMore specifically, in regions of India there is a somewhat widespread belief in tantra. While few practitioners would lend themselves to scientific studies for reasons explained above, there has been one notable appearance where Indias allegedly most powerful tantrik was challenged in live TV in front of an audience of millions of people, to kill a person with the aid of black magic alone.\n\n\n\nRationalist International has a good writeup on the story. In short, the tantrik claimed he could kill any person he wanted within three minutes, but did not manage to inflict any sort of damage during what went on for more than three hours. Rationalist International concludes:\n\n\n  Tantra power had miserably failed. Tantriks are creating such a scaring atmosphere that even people, who know that black magic has no base, can just break down out of fear, commented a scientist during the program. It needs enormous courage and confidence to challenge them by actually putting one\u2019s life at risk, he said. By doing so, Sanal Edamaruku has broken the spell, and has taken away much of the fear of those who witnessed his triumph.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3331#3336", "answerId": "3336"}

At a range of about 1500 km, with an elevation of about 200 meters for the Armavir site, you get visibility of a Blue Sparrow at apogee at just under 1400 km. At that range the target would appear to be just coming above the horizon. One small problem: there are mountains in Turkey, and they're in the way! Terrain is pretty consistently at about 5000 feet in elevation on a line of sight between the Armavir radar and the launch area in the eastern Med. Basically, Blue Sparrow isn't getting high enough for anyone to see it. Plus, if you want to throw in the \"but maybe it was an OTH-SW\" or \"well maybe Voronezh can be an OTH-SW\" argument, great...but the target is still going to be in the blind zone manifested downrange by the terrain, and therefore invisible. The only way Armavir makes any sense at all mathematically is if the target missile had a much higher apogee, but physically it seems to be topping out at about 100 km based on the motor characteristics and mass. Prior launches only hit apogees of about 40 km max, although they were using the Black Sparrow target designed to simulate slower SRBMs. Silver Sparrow is supposed to be a new system emulating more capable threats than Blue Sparrow, but little info is available and even if you jack up the apogee substantially (which you really can't, it's supposed to be about the same size as Blue Sparrow) there's still the issue of Turkish terrain. And actually, the report seems to indicate that this was in fact potentially a Silver Sparrow test as it mentions a new Sparrow variant. Plus the report at the link mentions that they detected the launches, but they did not specify with what system.\n  \n  Anyway, if they could track the target missile using a radar site (like one of the ships in the Med), they'd also be able to potentially track things like SCUDs fired within Syria. What likely happened was that they got an IR hit from a satellite of both the Sparrow booster igniting and the subsequent Arrow launch: the two \"ballistic\" launches.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/17791#17792", "answerId": "17792"}

However, I draw a very different conclusion from it, and I didn't want to edit the answer that substantially... I decided to go with a separate Community Wiki answer.\n\nNo, the bomb calorimiter values are not the definitive measure of calorific values.\n\n\nNutrition Labeling of Carbohydrates: Definition, Analyses, and Caloric Calculations by Betty Wang Li, National Nutrient Databank Conference 18, 1993\n\n\nIn this conference paper, the techniques used to adhere to FDA Food Labelling guidelines are described and their limitations discussed.\n\n\n  For regulatory purposes, five options have been provided for the calculation of caloric content of foods. They are\n  \n  \n  specific Atwater food factors,\n  general factors of 4, 4, and 9 calories per gram of protein, total carbohydrate including dietary fiber, and fat, respectively,\n  same as 2. except that insoluble dietary fiber content may be subtracted from total carbohydrate content,\n  specific factors for particular food ingredients petitioned by manufacturers/users and approved by FDA as appropriate, and\n  bomb calorimetry data after subtraction of 1.25 calories per gram of protein.\n  \n\n\nThis demonstrates that the nutritional labelling does not rely on bomb calorimetry data without regard for the factors the question was concerned about. If a bomb calorimeter would give an unfair over-estimate, the manufacturer can use a more reasonable evaluation of the components. If even that is unreasonable, (I assume olestra would be an example,) they may request a ruling for a different technique.\n\nThe paper gives examples of how the different techniques (plus UK labelling regulations) give different answers.\n\nIt also explains how chromatographic techniques can be used to measure the different types of sugar levels of foods, such as honey.\n\nIgnoring the water content, wood would consist of largely insoluble dietary fiber (which the paper demonstrates can be defined physiological, chemically or gravimetrically, and that the guidelines stipulate the last definition.)\n\nThe paper does point out there are some unanswered questions, such as whether all soluble dietary fibers, by the legal definition, have the same physiological effects.\n\nIn conclusion, the textbooks were the ones over-simplifying the process.

{"question": "Is whole-grain bread healthier than white bread?", "questionId": "19667", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19667", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "It's Hard to Say\n\nNutrition is a tough area to make strong black-and-white statements. \n\n\nBread preference is correlated with other health-affecting lifestyle choices, so we can't just measure the health of people who prefer one bread over another.\nIt's hard to do a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial over the lifetime of a large sample of people, substituting wholemeal bread for white bread. \nIt is made worse, because the area has a lot of mixed results and contradictory band-wagons (at least, in the public eye).\nSome nutrients are needed (or need to be avoided) by a small proportion of the population, and may be of little consequence to otherwise healthy individuals.\n\"White bread\", \"brown bread\" (or even \"wheat bread\") are not tight specifications of bread, but, rather broad categories.\nThe issue of white versus brown bread was already raging in 1924.\n\n\nSo I cannot give a simple answer.\n\n\n\nThey Are Not The Same\n\nWhat I can say is \"there is a difference\". If the original claim was meant to imply they are nutritionally identical (as opposed to merely equally healthful), it is incorrect.\n\n\nGastric emptying of wholemeal and white bread, 1977\n\n\n  We studied the rates at which solid and liquid leave the stomach after meals of wholemeal and white bread by using a double isotope technique. There was no difference in the rates at which the solid phases of the gastric contents left the stomach but liquid left the stomach significantly more rapidly with white bread than with wholemeal bread. Furthermore, the amount of liquid leaving the stomach unaccompanied and therefore unbuffered by solid was significantly greater after while bread than wholemeal bread. These findings may be of significance in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer and they provide a rational basis for a possible form of dietary treatment.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\nBreaking it Down\n\nTo deal with this quandary, I am going to look at some individual nutrients. Note: This approach risks the fallacy of composition. It may be that some combination of nutrients has more or less effect that the individual nutrients would suggest. For example, it has been shown that adding bran to wheat bread reduces iron absorption. We therefore need to treat these results with some care.\n\n(I have done this with a number of the most obvious nutrients, until I started to get bored. I avoided cherry-picking; every nutrient I researched is included here. If there are other nutrients worth including, please add a comment or edit it in.)\n\nIn alphabetical order:\n\nCalcium\n\nEating brown bread over white bread increases the intake of calcium from other sources - specifically milk-products. 66% of pregnant women are calcium deficient.\n\nCalories\n\nWholewheat bread has slightly more calories than white bread, but not as much as Wonder bread.\n\nFat\n\nWholewheat bread has similar fat levels to white bread\n\nFibre\n\nWholewheat bread has three times the level of dietary fibre of  white bread. Insufficient fibre in North American diets is common and associated with a large number of gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nFurther, intake of whole grains have been reliably associated with lower rates of colorectal and gastric cancers, and maybe endometrial cancer and coronary heart disease.\n\nIron\n\nWheat bread provides more iron that unfortified white bread, and about the same as iron-salt-fortified white bread. (Watch out the for the bran though - see above.) Iron deficiency is a prevalent form of malnutrition world-wide. While less common in North America, it still causes thousands of deaths.\n\nPotassium\n\nWholewheat bread has less than half the potassium of white bread. While low potassium intake is linked to diabetes, most people in the USA get enough potassium from their diets.\n\nSodium\n\nWholewheat bread has lower sodium levels than white bread.  In the USA, up to 70% of adults are at risk of sodium-related health problems.\n\nVitamin B-6\n\nWhole wheat bread has more B-6 in it that white bread, and about the same as B-6 fortified white bread. However, B-6 is slightly less available after eating whole wheat bread.\n\nZinc\n\nYou absorb more zinc from eating brown bread. A quarter of the world's population is zinc-deficient.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile attempts to answer with a definitive study are missing, by looking at the individual nutrients involved, whole-wheat bread offers more of a number of nutrients associated with better health, with a proviso that bran can reduce iron absorption, and that fortification of white-bread can remedy many of these differences.\n\nAlso, white bread tastes better! :-)\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19667#20058", "answerId": "20058"}

Thus, there were articles that state \"It is generally accepted that skipping breakfast is associated with higher incidences of cardiovascular disease.\" but not \"Skipping breakfast was shown to cause heart disease.\" To quote St-Onge et al. \"findings from observational studies cannot establish causality.\" All bolded words in block quotes are my own added emphasis.\n\nIn the below answer are some studies that I found relevant to the question (please point out if I am drawing conclusions when I  shouldn't).\n\nIn 2018, Uzhova et al. wrote\n\n\n  Breakfast is considered to be one of the most important meals of the day. [Breakfast's] omission has been reported to be associated with increased disease risk, such as obesity, diabetes, and coronary heart disease, as well as unhealthy lifestyle and lower dietary quality.\n  \n  Breakfast skipping, conversely, has been reported to be associated with several cardiovascular risk factors, including unfavorable lipid profile, obesity, and diabetes, as well as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease\n\n\nAlso in 2018, Sharma et al. studied coronary artery disease (CAD) in Western Indians.\n\n\n  Our primary finding suggests that apart from classical risk factors of CAD breakfast skipping is an independent associate of CAD in Indians. We found that habitual breakfast skippers are at 1.34 times (P = 0.009; 95% CI 1.076\u20131.689) higher risk of developing CAD when compared with breakfast eaters. One of the alarming finding of the study is that, the habit of skipping the breakfast imparts more risk than physical inactivity (odds ratio: 0.520; 95% CI 0.413\u20130.656; P &lt; 0.0001) and obesity (odds ratio: 0.670; 95% CI 0.534\u20130.841; P = 0.001) in Indians. Breakfast skippers also demonstrated greater tendency of development of hypertension as indicated by higher correlation coefficient (0.05, P = 0.043).\n  \n  Breakfast skipping is one of the important risk factor[s] of CAD and hypertension in Western Indians...\n\n\nIn 2017, St-Onge et al. wrote\n\n\n  Finally, data suggest that irregular eating patterns [including skipping breakfast] appear less favorable for achieving a healthy cardiometabolic profile.\n  \n  Because feeding and fasting entrain clock genes, which regulate all aspects of metabolism, meal timing can have serious implications for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity.\n  \n  In cross-sectional studies, daily breakfast eaters were less likely to have CVD risk factors, including elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, low serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and elevated blood pressure.\n  \n  To the best of our knowledge, only 2 prospective studies have examined the association between breakfast skipping and risk of CVD. Over 16 years of follow-up, men who reported usually skipping breakfast had a 27% (relative risk, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06\u20131.53) higher risk of CHD (defined as a nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD) compared with men who did not skip breakfast after adjustment for age, demographic factors, and dietary and lifestyle factors. In the second study, conducted in Japan, infrequent breakfast consumption was associated with a greater risk of CVD, specifically greater risk of hemorrhagic stroke, after adjustment for age, sex, dietary and lifestyle factors, perceived mental stress, living alone, physical labor, and public health center area.\n  \n  Epidemiological studies provide strong evidence of a relation between breakfast skipping and cardiometabolic risk. ... Although findings from observational studies cannot establish causality, large, prospective studies with long-term follow-up and the assessment of clinical end points, including CVD and diabetes mellitus, can provide important insight into these associations. These are particularly meaningful when supported by evidence from experimental studies and clinical interventions.\n\n\nA 2019 study from 6 days ago associated skipping breakfast with myocardial infarction (or heart attacks).\n\n\n  Epidemiological and interventional studies suggest that skipping breakfast and late-night dinner eating (LNDE) are associated with a greater risk of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases.\n  \n  In conclusion, the association between skipping breakfast concomitant with LNDE increases four to fivefold the likelihood of death, reinfarction and postinfarction angina within 30 days after hospital discharge.\n\n\nCahill et al. studied correlations between coronary heart disease and skipping breakfast in 2013.\n\n\n  Eating breakfast was associated with significantly lower CHD [coronary heart disease] risk in this cohort of male health professionals.\n\n\nAs part of the procedure, Cahill et al. accounted for lifestyle effects.\n\n\n  Multivariate models were adjusted for known and suspected risk factors of CHD such as energy intake (quintiles of kilocalories per day), alcohol intake (0, 0.1\u2013&lt;5, 5\u2013&lt;15, 15\u2013&lt;30, \u226530 g/d), diet quality using the 2010 Alternate Healthy Eating Index (quintiles of score), physical activity (quintiles of metabolic equivalent hours per week), television watching (asked in categories 0\u20131.5, 2.0\u20136.0, 7.0\u201320.0, \u226521.0 h/wk), sleep (&lt;7, 7\u20138, >8 h/24 h), smoking status (never, past, current), marital status (married, not married), full-time work status (yes, no), a physical examination in the last 2 years (yes, no), and family history of CHD &lt;60 years of age (yes, no). We then additionally adjusted for potential mediators, including diabetes mellitus (yes, no), hypertension (yes, no), hypercholesterolemia (yes, no), and BMI (&lt;18.5,18.5\u201324.9, 25\u201329.9, \u226530 kg/m2). These variables were updated for each 2-year follow-up period, as were all covariates except dietary covariates, which were updated every 4 years. Cumulative averages of dietary covariates were calculated at each time point to better represent long-term diet and to minimize within-person variation.\n\n\nFinally, a 2010 study by Smith et al. wrote\n\n\n  Skipping breakfast over a long period may have detrimental effects on cardiometabolic health. Promoting the benefits of eating breakfast could be a simple and important public health message.\n\n\nIn addition, the American Heart Association advocates eating breakfast due to the risks of skipping breakfast (quoted below).\n\n\n  Some studies indicate that breakfast-skippers are more likely to:\n  \n  \n  have diabetes, heart disease and high cholesterol\n  \n\n\nTo summarize:\n\n\n  Can skipping breakfast increase risk of heart disease?\n\n\nSkipping breakfast has been correlated with an increased risk of heart disease in many studies. This appears to be the scientific consensus and appears undisputed. Thus, the results of the University of Iowa study are not unexpected. The difference with this new study is that the authors also explicitly looked at mortality rather than just risk factors and/or incidences of cardiovascular diseases.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/43883#43884", "answerId": "43884"}
{"question": "Is climate change currently good for the world economy?", "questionId": "18136", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/18136", "category": "climate-change", "categoryId": 1, "answer": "The first quote presents a specious argument as I rather doubt the heat and cold related deaths includes deaths due to famine, which often involve crop-failures where weather/climate was an issue, which can easily affect hundreds of thousands or even millions in a single year, which clearly outweighs Lomborg's \"by mid-century\" figures.  The recent famine in Somalia alone is estimated to have resulted in 258,000 deaths. Much of the worlds populations depends on the productivity of agricultural land already becoming marginal.  The greatest agricultural effects of climate change are likely to be due to changes in rainfall, and sea level rise (much of Bangladesh, a very populous country, is low lying and already susceptible to flooding) rather than the direct effects of increased temperature.\n\nThe evidence for the \"CO2 is plant food\" argument is also at best equivocal.  Increased CO2 may increase gross primary production in areas where sunlight, water and the availability of nutrients are not already the limiting factors.  Increasing CO2 may benefit some plants and disadvantage others (via the effects of climate change on temperature and precipitation), and it is far from clear that there will be a net benefit (see SkS link given below for more details and links to the peer reviewed literature).\n\nThe quote \"A Scorecard From 1900 to 2050, shows that since 1900, global warming has been an increasing net benefit for humanity and will peak around 2025 with an annual benefit of about 1.5% of GDP.\" is a rather specious argument if used to argue against climate change mitigation.  A net benefit can be achieved by providing a very large benefit to a few at the expense of catastrophic loss to millions.  Just because something is a net benefit in terms of GDP, that doesn't mean that it is a net benefit to humanity.  Note Tol also goes on to say \"Only toward the end of the century will global warming turn to a net loss \u2014 so while we need to do something, it must be cost-effective.\", this is basically saying that the net loss will be someone else's problem, so why should I care?  Economists have a name for this which is \"discounting\".  I would agree that any action should be cost effective, but it needs to be based on a full analysis of the costs and benefits.\n\nUpdate, Prof. Tol supports some of what I have said above in a recent paper, for which the abstract is given below (emphasis mine)\n\nThe national version of FUND3.6 is used to backcast the impacts of climate change to the 20th century and extrapolate to the 21st century. Carbon dioxide fertilization of crops and reduced energy demand for heating are the main positive impacts. Climate change had a negative effect on water resources and, in most years, human health. Most countries benefitted from climate change until 1980, but after that the trend is negative for poor countries and positive for rich countries. The global average impact was positive in the 20th century. In the 21st century, impacts turn negative in most countries, rich and poor. Energy demand, water resources, biodiversity and sea level rise are the main negative impacts; the impacts of climate change on human health and agriculture remain positive until 2100.\n\nWhich suggest that currently (i.e. post 1980), climate change is beneficial for already rich countries but has a negative impact on poor countries.  GDP is only one measure of the economy and increasing GDP isn't necessarily an indicator of the health of the global economy if it results in a greater polarisation of rich and poor countries.\n\nSkepticalScience.com has a number of pages with relevant information, including  \"its not bad\", \"animals and plants can adapt\", \"CO2 is plant food\", \"how big is the carbon fertilisation effect\", which all contain links to the primary literature on relevant issues.  The IPPC reports would also be well worth reading, as assessing the cost of the impacts of climate change is the subject of the reports from working groups 2 and 3.\n\nIncidentally, a Google scholar search for \"effect of climate change on GDP\" provides \"Climate change is already damaging global economy, report finds\", Climate Change Reducing Global GDP by $1.2 Trillion, etc.  The IPCC say:\n\n\"Most of the aggregate impacts reported in IPCC (1996) were of the first type; they monetised the likely damage that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 concentrations. For developed countries, estimated damages were of the order of 1% of GDP. Developing countries were expected to suffer larger percentage damages, so mean global losses of 1.5 to 3.5% of world GDP were therefore reported.\"\n\nAnd the Stern Review also comes in strongly in favour of mitigation on economic grounds, so I would suggest that the idea that climate change is good for the world economy is at best, highly equivocal. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/18136#18171", "answerId": "18171"}

Palliative care that results in death is not considered\n  to be criminal, so long as four conditions are satisfied: (1) the care\n  must be intended solely to relieve suffering; (2) it must be\n  administered in response to suffering or signs of suffering; (3) it\n  must commensurate with that suffering; and (4) it cannot be a\n  deliberate infliction of death. Documentation is required, and the\n  doses must increase progressively.\n  \n  There is no precedent in this area. There have never been any legal\n  convictions for providing such treatment and although there are no\n  decided cases on point, a reference was made to the practice of\n  providing potentially life-shortening treatment with the purpose of\n  alleviating suffering in the Rodriguez case. The real issue in that\n  case concerned assisted suicide under section 241 of the Criminal\n  Code. Mr. Justice Sopinka, writing for the majority of the Supreme\n  Court of Canada, however, drew a legal distinction, based on\n  intention, between the administration of drugs that are likely to\n  hasten death on the one hand and assistance in suicide on the other.\n  Without deciding the issue, by implication he seems to have suggested\n  that if the intention is to alleviate suffering, it is legally\n  permissible to provide treatment notwithstanding that this may hasten\n  death.\n\n\nThe above says, \"potentially life-shortening\" and \"likely to hasten\".\n\nSome of the paragraphs after that imply that the expert witnesses disagreed about whether it will in fact shorten life, for example:\n\n\n  Professor Schafer, testified: If we think about it, what the\n  palliative care physician frequently does in giving an adequate dose\n  of painkilling medication is hasten the death of the patient, entirely\n  justifiably in my judgment, and entirely justifiably in the judgment\n  of every one of my philosophical and legal colleagues whose briefs I\n  have read.\n\n\ncompared with:\n\n\n  Dr. Macdonald stated: Another area of confusion is whether or not we\n  are killing the patient with these drugs. That was a subject of\n  correspondence I had with the committee. People think, for example, if\n  we increase the dose of opioids so that a person is stuporous, we may\n  kill the patient if we give them a little more. In my experience, that\n  is highly unlikely to happen. Patients rapidly become tolerant to the\n  respiratory effects of opioids, morphine and like drugs. If we give\n  them a large dosage of a drug, we may sedate the patient but it is\n  unlikely that the patient would die of our drug. They may die of\n  pneumonia or an associated problem which sedation might make more\n  likely to come about, but to die directly of a drug effect is unusual.\n\n\nThe last two sentences above implies that it shouldn't cause death directly, but may indirectly.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/14466#14472", "answerId": "14472"}

They produced it by bombarding uranium-238 with deuterium nuclei (alpha particles). This first produced neptunium-238 with a half-life of two days, and this decayed by beta emission to form element 94 (plutonium). Within a couple of months element 94 had been conclusively identified and its basic chemistry shown to be like that of uranium.\n  To begin with, the amounts of plutonium produced were invisible to the eye, but by August 1942 there was enough to see and weigh, albeit only 3 millionths of a gram. However, by 1945 the Americans had several kilograms, and enough plutonium to make three atomic bombs, one of which exploded over Nagasaki in August 1945\n\n\nThe US effort to build a nuclear bomb got the name Manhattan project no earlier than 1941*, so there is no contradiction there.\n\nBut plutonium does exist in nature (note that you are not asking about a specific isotope), as is e.g. shown in The Occurrence of Plutonium in Nature by Charles A. Levine and Glenn T. Seaborg (PDF avalable here):\n\n\n  Plutonium has been chemically separated from seven different ores and the ratios of plutonium to uranium determined. This ratio was found to be fairly constant (approx. 10-11) in pitchblende and monazite ores, ...\n\n\nIn his autobiography (G.T. Seaborg and E. Seaborg - Adventures in the atomic age: from Watts to Washington), Seaborg says more about the naming of Plutonium:\n\n\n  It was so difficult to make, from such rare materials, that we thought it would be the heaviest element ever formed. So we considered names like extremium and ultimium. Fortunately, we were spared the inevitable embarrassment that one courts when proclaiming a discovery to be the ultimate in any field by deciding to follow the nomenclatural precedents of the two prior elements.\n  A new planet had been discovered in 1781 and, like the rest of the planets, named for a Greek or Roman deity-Uranus. A scientist who discovered a heavy new element eight years later named it after the planet: uranium. The planet Neptune was discovered in 1846, so Ed McMillan followed this precedent and named element 93 neptunium. Conveniently for us, the final planet, Pluto, had been discovered in 1930. We briefly considered the form plutium, but plutonium seemed more euphonious.\n\n\nSo the element has existed since the formation of the Earth (and maybe earlier), but a) it was not known before December 1940 and b) it did not have the name plutonium.\n\n* I cannot find the exact date. As mentioned in this NY Times Article, that information is in the book The Manhattan Project: The Birth of the Atomic Bomb in the Words of Its Creators, Eyewitnesses, and Historians by Cynthia C.

The definitive answer as to what is, or is not, a psychological disorder is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) (5th edition release has been delayed to 2013).  A search of the document for the word \"liberal\" (with wildcards) only turns up three entries.\n\n\n  \n  Application of Trait Theory in Personality Synopsis at ALLPSYCH Online\n  Openness to experience refers to the dimension ranging from outgoing, liberal, interested in new things, and imaginative to reserved, conservative, traditional, and conforming.\n  allpsych.com/personalitysynopsis/trait_application.html\n  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Related to Prisoners of War in AllPsych Journal\n  Once liberated, soldiers are given a medical exam and ... years after the former prisoners of war have been liberated and readjusted to life.

The second return only got caught in the search because it mentions \"liberation\" in the context of being freed from captivity, and how that applies to PTSD.  None of them even hint at there being any association with a psychological disorder.\n\nYour citation of the two sources are a bit problematic.  First of all, Michael Savage is a well known ideologue.  You even use WorldNetDaily as your citation for him.  I would suggest that going to professional psychology sites where there are peer reviewed papers is a better and more impartial source.  Not books, which are not subject to that peer reviewed process.\n\n\n  In looking over a synopsis of Dr Rossiter's book, in a nutshell, the book's thesis is, \"My political views are so obviously correct that anyone who doesn't accept them just has to be nuts.\" It presupposes the truth of a right-wing political outlook and then tries to plumb the reasons why other people do not accept this truth, the conclusion being that they have to be in massive denial.\n\n\nThis is not particularly neutral either.\n\nUpon further research, it appears that Dr. Rossiter's book is a direct rebuttal to a government funded study titled Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition.  A study published in 2003.  Most of the claims in Dr. Rossiter's book are not so subtle reversals of the conclusions reached by Drs Jost JT, Glaser J, Kruglanski AW, and Sulloway FJ (listed authors of the paper, which HAD received peer review in the Psychological Bulletin as well as being supervised by the National Foundation as well as the National Institutes of Health).  As a counter point to some of the assertions by Dr. Rossiter, Dr Kruglanski states (about this study in particular):\n\n\n  \"The variables we talk about are general human dimensions,\" he said. \"These are the same dimensions that contribute to loyalty and commitment to the group. Liberals might be less intolerant of ambiguity, but they may be less decisive, less committed, less loyal.\" \n\n\nDr. Kruglanski added a disclaimer that their study \"does not mean that conservatism is pathological or that conservative beliefs are necessarily false\". \n\nSome of the items that Dr Rossiter objected to in particular were statements like:\n\n\n  \"This intolerance of ambiguity can lead people to cling to the familiar, to arrive at premature conclusions, and to impose simplistic cliches and stereotypes.\"\n\n\nand\n\n\n  The core ideology of conservatism stresses resistance to change and justification of inequality and is motivated by needs that vary situationally and dispositionally to manage uncertainty and threat.\n\n\nNeither of those statements make any particular value judgments, unlike Dr Rossiter's book.\n\nAs a counter to the Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition study, there is Bright Minds and Dark Attitudes: Lower Cognitive Ability Predicts Greater Prejudice Through Right-Wing Ideology and Low Intergroup Contact, published by Sage Journals.  This was published well after Dr. Rossiter's book, and carries a message that aligns with the political outlook that Dr Rossiter espouses, yet this paper makes no judgment on liberal (or \"left\") ideologies being a mental illness. Instead the paper focuses on:\n\n\n  Despite their important implications for interpersonal behaviors and relations, cognitive abilities have been largely ignored as explanations of prejudice.  We proposed and tested mediation models in which lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism) and low levels of contact with out-groups.\n\n\nFurthermore, there are many nuances that seem to get ignored in social discourse regarding conservatism and liberalism.  One can't really equate conservative with right-wing in all cases.  For many, right wing is a fiscal policy stance, while conservatism is a social policy, and people cross over those definitions in numerous permutations.\n\nSo again, Mr Savage and Dr Rossiter appear to have political and ideological motivation, and are using the hallmarks of that rhetoric.  There is no evidence their statements regarding liberalism (or any other political viewpoints) are supported as being a psychological disorder.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9099#9108", "answerId": "9108"}

{"question": "Can a trained human eye catch microexpressions?", "questionId": "10994", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10994", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Lets start with the eyes and perception [1].\n\n\n  The human eye and its brain interface, the human visual system, can\n  process 10 to 12 separate images per second, perceiving them\n  individually. The visual cortex holds onto one image for about\n  one-fifteenth of a second, so if another image is received during that\n  period an illusion of continuity is created, allowing a sequence of\n  still images to give the impression of motion.\n\n\nFrom this stance, it's certainly possible to to detect motion by at least 1/10 of a second (perhaps a twitch).  \n\nThe other part of this is determination of if the movement was involuntary or not, which is more or less a trained art. \n\nAnother type of microexpression is auditory microexpressions, which involves detection in the form of involuntary inflections of pitch in your in somebody's voice.  First, the biology of the ear [2]:\n\n\n  The inner ear, called the cochlea, has a remarkable thin compliant\n  membrane stretched out along inside it. This membrane is called the\n  basilar membrane, and it has two really interesting features. First,\n  it is resonant at different frequencies at different points along its\n  surface, and second, it is infused with thousands of nerve endings\n  (called hair cells) that are attached to the auditory nerve going to\n  the brain.   \n  \n  The net effect of these two features is that different\n  frequencies excite different hair cells, so that in a general (if\n  incomplete) way we can think of the mechanism as causing each hair\n  cell to be excited by a very specific range of frequencies. This leads\n  us to a concept called the \"place\" theory of pitch detection.\n\n\nSecondly how we perceive sound:\n\n\n  The shortest sound we can hear is an impulse about 20\n  microseconds long. This is related, of course, to the upper limit of\n  frequencies, about 20,000 Hz. We can theoretically hear sounds that\n  are indefinitely long. However, from a perceptual standpoint they\n  cease to be perceived as events and instead become \u201ca continuum.\u201d\n  ...\n  \n  Meanwhile, the sound events\n  (like musical notes and spoken words) that we work with in audio are\n  generally between 50 milliseconds (1/20th of a second) and five\n  seconds long.   There are two other primary things to know about the\n  time dimension. The first is that there is a fundamental neurological\n  boundary for humans at about 50 milliseconds. Events occurring more\n  quickly than that are perceived as a single or continuous event, not\n  as a series of events. Events occurring less quickly are perceived as\n  separate individual events. This holds true for vision as well (hence\n  our 30 fps rate for film). So as I noted earlier, a 5 Hz square wave\n  will be heard as a series of clicks, while a 50 Hz square wave will be\n  heard as a continuous tone.   The other time phenomenon worth keeping\n  in mind is our integration time. When we perceive \u201ca sound,\u201d we\n  integrate all of the versions of that sound that occur within the\n  first 50 milliseconds of the sound into a single holistic perception.\n  So we sort of average all versions of a sound that occur during that\n  period to produce our conscious perception of the sound source. We\n  will discuss this at considerable length in later articles.   Finally,\n  we have to keep in mind that frequencies are a subset of the time\n  dimension. Individual pitched (periodic) sounds consist of an array of\n  frequencies, as I mentioned above. The lowest such frequencies\n  (fundamentals) usually fall within a four octave range from about 60\n  Hz to 1 kHz All frequencies above 1 kHz can be regarded as harmonics\n  that enable us to determine timbre and differentiate sounds from each\n  other.\n\n\nThis latter part of about perception of sound is rather interesting when compbined with visual microexpression.  The two sences seem to enhance one another if experienced simultaneously (ie, face to face conversations).\n\nThere is certainly potential for detection, but it's up to perceiver to decide whether it is indeed a microexpression.  So what's the success rate in determining of a trained eye?  Taken from the book \"The Philosophy of Deceptions\" and it's research, we find:\n\n\n  Measurements we have made of facial movements, voice, and speach show\n  that high levels of accuracy are possible - over 80 percent correct\n  classifications of who is lying and who is telling the truct.  While\n  making those measurements required slow-motion replays, we also know\n  that accurate judgments are possible just by viewing the videotapes. A\n  small percent of thos we have studied have reached 80 percent or\n  better accuracy, and tey have done so in more than one scenario, so it\n  unlikely that their accuracy was a fluke (O'Sullivan and Ekman 2005).\n\n\nSo, more often than not, a human eye CAN catch microexpressions in real-time.\n\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate\n\n[2] http://www.recordingmag.com/resources/resourceDetail/194.html\n\n[3] The Philosophy of Deception Pg 123\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10994#11048", "answerId": "11048"}

This moderate increase of 2% in 2013 compared to 2012 is a continuation of last year\u2019s trend and of the slowdown in the annual emissions growth. The actual increase of 2012 compared to 2011 was 0.6 Gt or 1.7% (excluding leap year correction) and both are about half the average annual growth rate of 1.1 Gt or 3.8% since 2003 (excluding the 2008\u20132009 recession years). Note that the average annual emission increase in the 1995\u20132002 period (after the large decline in energy consumption in the former Soviet Union countries) was about 1.2% or 0.4 Gt CO2 per year. With the global economic growth of 3.4% and 3.1%, in 2012 and 2013 respectively, a further decoupling of the global economic and emission trends can be observed. This decoupling is consistent with the increasing service sector share (growing by 1.5% and 1.8% in 2012 and 2013 on average in middle income countries, including China) to the overall gross domestic product, at the expense of more energy-intensive industrial activities.\n\n\nSee also Global growth in CO2 emissions plateaus\n\n\n  After a decade of rapid growth in global CO2 emissions, which increased at an average annual rate of 4%, much smaller increases were registered in 2012 (0.8%), 2013 (1.5%) and 2014 (0.5%). \n\n\nAlso, from Global Carbon Budget 2012\n\n\n\nSee also Reaching peak emissions Nature Climate Change volume 6, pages 7-10, which projects that CO2 emissions actually decreased 0.6% from 2014 to 2015.  \n\nSo 6% rate of growth is not representative of what is happening currently.  \n\nHowever, according to Figure 4.1 of Reducing CO2 Emissions: A Comparative Input-Output-Study for Germany and the UK, world CO2 emissions reached a peak year over year percent increase of about 5.5 in 1967.

The Yemeni national has created a formula that may prove ground-breaking in the world of quantum mathematics. It could forever change the dynamics of what we consider space.\n\n\n\nThe gulf article said that she is may soon join the ranks of the scientists and discoverers, while Wikipedia paraphrased it as she redefined.\nThe gulf article said that has created a formula that may prove ground-breaking, while Wikipedia paraphrased it as she developed a groundbreaking working formula in the field of quantum mathematics. \n\n\n\n  But is it true that she wrote a \"350 pages\" formula to measures distance in space without the use of light? If so, where is it published and how can one find it?\n\n\nGood question. Now, we're asking about whether she wrote a 350 pages formula, regardless whether it is scientifically correct or not. \n\nIt is reported in another gulf article called Dubai resident brings Arab genius into equation that:\n\n\n  Having worked on the 350-page formula relating to \u2018Structure Variation Hyper Arithmetical Sort Operators and Applications\u2019 for a few years now, Manahel along with her team is trying to redefine the method of measuring distances across the universe using new particles.

{"question": "Do water molecules change when you talk to them?", "questionId": "19979", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19979", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "Words are just that \u2013 words. They have no power whatsoever and the laws of physics do not distinguish between \"good\" words and \"bad\" words.\n\nYou speak English, which happens to be one of many thousands of languages that have developed over the centuries. There is no general rule that allows you to categorise \"good\" words and \"bad\" words. In some languages the same words mean the complete opposite - e.g. c\u030cerstvy\u0301 in Czech means \"fresh\", while czerstwy in Polish (pronounced the same) means \"old\", \"stale\" and \"bad\". There are many cases where words that sound exactly the same have a completely different meaning.\n\nSimilarly \"nice music\" is a relative term, the laws of physics cannot distinguish between music that someone finds nice and not nice.\n\nMusic and spoken words are sound waves that can make the water molecules vibrate. However this will not change the \"shape\" of the molecule, a molecule that is pretty simple (H2O). Moreover a molecule doesn't really have a \"shape\" per say, it is just a collection of particles that keep quite close to each other and follow a certain \"structure\". A quote from Wikipedia:\n\n\n  Molecules have fixed equilibrium geometries\u2014bond lengths and angles\u2014 about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure.\n\n\nOnly isomers of the same molecule have a different structure, and they become an isomer through a process called isomerization, however this cannot be practically caused by sound waves*, especially by those caused by voice or music.\n\nFinally it is impossible for water to \"align in the wrong order\". A single molecule of water is two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to a single oxygen atom. You cannot \"reorder\" those atoms. When an atom is covalently bonded with another one, it means that it is sharing an electron pair with another atom. Since a hydrogen atom has only one electron, it cannot be bonded with two atoms, only one - this is why reordering is impossible, you can't have H-H-O instead of H-O-H - the latter is the only possible \"order\". It is also impossible for a water molecule to become ugly. Here is a water molecule:\n\n\nIgnoring the fact that we've already established that it is impossible to change its structure, I can't really understand how a structure so simple can become \"ugly\".\n\nThis might be related to Masaru Emoto's claims that water can react to intentions, which can be seen by freezing water and looking at the frozen crystals - it was also based around the idea of talking to water, but focusing more on human consciousness and emotions rather than just the sound. He would even go as far as suggesting that exposing water to certain pictures would have an effect on it. However an experiment has proven these claims to not be true. Emoto also refused James Randi's US$1,000,000 challenge to reproduce his own experiment with frozen water. His claims are widely considered to be pseudo-science and to violate basic laws of physics. Moreover the experiment itself and methods used have been criticized and described as not being able to verify his own claims. Physician Harriet A. Hall wrote that \"This watery fantasy is all very entertaining and imaginative, full of New Age feel-good platitudes, holistic oneness, consciousness raising, and warm fuzzies; but it's hard to see how anyone could mistake it for science.\"\n\n* Some isomerization happens when molecules get heated up in a presence of a catalyst. It is therefore theoretically possible to use sound waves to heat up a substance, since sound is also energy. An average yell lasting a single second would warm a glass of water 0.00000095 degrees Celsius. It is therefore theoretically possible to heat up a substance using very long shouting (we're talking months of constant, non-stopping yelling) in order to produce an isomer of a molecule, however this does not apply to water molecules and is generally a crazy idea.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19979#19996", "answerId": "19996"}

Small changes in the extracellular potassium level can have profound effects on the function of the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems.\n\nLow potassium (hypokalemia) refers to a lower than normal level of potassium in your bloodstream. Potassium is a chemical (electrolyte) that is critical to the proper functioning of nerve and muscles cells, particularly heart muscle cells. Hypokalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mEq/L (3.5 mmol/L). Severe hypokalemia is a level of less than 2.5 mEq/L. \n\nMost cases of hypokalemia occur in the setting of specific disease states, and most common cause of low potassium is excessive potassium loss in urine or from the digestive tract, transcellular shift (movement of potassium from serum into cells), or the direct effect of medications. Only rarely is low potassium due to sweating or not getting enough potassium in your diet. \n\nPatients are often asymptomatic, particularly those with mild hypokalemia. Symptoms that are present are often from the underlying cause of the hypokalemia rather than the hypokalemia itself. The symptoms of hypokalemia are nonspecific and predominantly are related to muscular or cardiac function. \n\nThose symptoms include: weakness and fatigue (most common), palpitations, psychological symptoms (eg, psychosis, delirium, hallucinations, depression). Muscle cramps and pain are only present in severe cases, as Troponin's (a regulatory protein complex that is integral to muscle contraction in skeletal and cardiac muscle) becomes impaired. Therefore, hypokalemia can hyperpolarize skeletal muscle cells, impairing their ability to develop the depolarization necessary for muscle contraction. It can also reduce blood flow to skeletal muscles. The reduced blood flow can predispose patients to Rhabdomyolysis (damaged skeletal muscle tissue breaks down its breakdown products are released into the bloodstream) especially when vigorous exercise is combined with impaired blood-flow regulation. The combination of these effects frequently leads to muscle weakness, easy fatigability, cramping, and myalgias.

{"question": "Does astrology work?", "questionId": "2442", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2442", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Dr. Phil Plait, and Astronomer, has a great write up that debunks astrology (I cannot encourage you enough to read that page (or the google cache of it).)  Sadly his web page seems to be down, so here\u2019s the Google Cache copy of the same page.  After a long discussion and research (with sources), he concludes with\n\n\n  There is no force, known or unknown, that could possibly affect us here on Earth the way astrologers claim. Known forces weaken too fast, letting one source utterly dominate (the Moon for gravity, the Sun for electromagnetism). An unknown force would allow asteroids and extrasolar planets to totally overwhelm the nearby planets.\n  \n  Astrologers tend to rely on our ability to remember hits and forget misses. Even an accurate prediction may be simple chance.\n  \n  Study after study has shown that claims and predictions made by astrologers have no merit. They are indistinguishable from chance, which means astrologers cannot claim to have some ability to predict your life's path.\n  \n  There is harm, real harm, in astrology. It weakens further people's ability to rationally look at the world, an ability we need now more than ever. \n\n\nNow let's look at other places.\n\nIf you want to look at this scientifically though, the first questions to ask:  By what mechanism does this work?  Why are predictions always very vague?  And if the questions are specific, why are they no better than cold reading?\n\nEmily Lu from the Palomar observatory (another Astronomy site) makes these great observations.\n\n\n  With the scientific knowledge that we have gained in recent history, there is little reason to place much trust in the notion that the Sun, Moon, or planets will affect your day to day life. Five thoughts:\n  \n  1) Distances. As anyone who has taken introductory physics should know, the force of gravity goes with the inverse square of the distance... i.e., the further a body is from you, the less it will affect you. Remember how far away Earth is from the Sun, Moon, and planets (hint: MILLIONS of miles). Though the person who delivered you at birth may be much less massive than any celestial body, they are much closer and would certainly affect you more than the positions of the planets.\n  \n  2) Other influences. For argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say that there is some unknown force that far-away celestial bodies do exert. The laws of physics have yet to be completely understood, so I\u2019ll concede that it may be possible that there is something that works independently of distance and might influence the lives of people. But if that force is not distance dependent, why aren\u2019t stars, galaxies, quasars, or black holes included in astrological forecasts?\n  \n  3) Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The three outermost planets were only discovered within the past three centuries. How does that work with the claim that astrologers make about the accuracy of their art for previous times?\n  \n  4) Precession of the Earth. Due to the slight wobbling of the Earth\u2019s axis, the current position of objects in the zodiac circle are no longer consistent with the tenets of astrology set up thousands of years ago. Your \"sun sign\" is actually currently shifted over by one (i.e., a Leo is really a Cancer).\n  \n  5) Build me a house of ham. If you\u2019ve thought about the human reproductive process, you know that a baby spends about 9 months gestating in the mother\u2019s womb before it is born. Why, then, does your birth time matter? Shouldn\u2019t it really be the time of conception that would affect who the baby is to become? Or is it that the muscular lining of the mother protects the fetus from all external forces? In that case, shouldn\u2019t a ham enclosure do the trick? \n\n\nJames Randi has a great video on the subject as well.\n\nAlso, here is an old video from Carl Sagan's Cosmos series that deals with Astrology.  Note how he is reading the same astrology sign from multiple papers.\n\nFor some humour on the subject, check out this comic (not totally relevant, but funny none the less since I mentioned Carl Sagan).\n\nKeep in mind, any sort of \"debunking\" of this fervent wish by believers will meet with resistance.  There will be explanations and rationalizations, but much like any \"psychic\", there is no distinguishing this from chance, or the art of cold reading (should you be visiting an astrologer).  Confirmation bias will do the rest for you.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that astrology has tried to legitimize itself in complexity.  Thus there is no single one answer or smoking gun that can be used to talk about it.  Rather, a myriad of answers are required to fully understand what is going on.  The human brain's pattern recognition software is poor in this sense, and that is why people will fall for this.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2442#2444", "answerId": "2444"}

They simply mean that the gastrointestinal tract is working. A health care provider can check abdominal sounds by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope (auscultation).\" Stomach rumblings can be caused by gas moving through the intestines which is referred to as borborygmi.  \u2028\u2028Loud borborygmi or rumblings may result from contractions of the intestines caused by diseases like Crohn\u2019s disease or bowel obstruction.\n\nPer Mark A. W. Andrews in Scientific American 2002, \"The physiological origin of this rumbling involves muscular activity in the stomach and small intestines. When the walls are activated and squeeze the tract's contents to mix and propel food, gas and fluids through the stomach and small intestines, it generates a rumbling noise. This squeezing of the muscular walls is termed peristalsis and involves a ring of contraction moving aborally (away from the oral cavity) towards the anus a few inches at a time.\n\n\"The generation of these waves of peristalsis results from a rhythmic fluctuation of electrical potential in the smooth muscle cells, which, all other conditions being appropriate, will cause the muscle to contract. This fluctuation is called the basic electrical rhythm (BER) and is a result of inherent activity of the enteric nervous system, which is found in the walls of the gut. The BER causes the muscle cells of the stomach and small intestines to activate at a regular rhythm (three and 12 times per minute, respectively), in a manner similar to, but slower than, the rhythmicity of cardiac muscle in the heart. receptors in the walls of the stomach sense the absence of food, causing a reflex generation of waves of electrical activity (migrating myoelectric complexes, or MMCs) in the enteric nervous system. These MMCs travel along the stomach and small intestines and lead to hunger contractions. However, there are some cases in which abnormal sounds can indicate a problem.\" \n\nThere are three kinds of bowel sounds, hypoactive, hyperactive and absent.\n\n\nReduced (hypoactive) bowel sounds mean a reduction in the loudness, tone, or regularity of the sounds and may be a sign of slowness of intestinal activity. \"Hypoactive bowel sounds are normal during sleep. They also occur normally for a short time after the use of certain medicines and after abdominal surgery.  Ileus is a condition in which there is a lack of intestinal activity which may cause gas, fluids, and the contents of the intestines to build up and break open (rupture) the bowel wall.\"\n\"Increased (hyperactive) bowel sounds can sometimes be heard even without a stethoscope. Hyperactive bowel sounds mean there is an increase in intestinal activity. This may happen with diarrhea or after eating. No bowel sounds after a period of hyperactive bowel sounds can mean there is a rupture of the intestines, or strangulation of the bowel and death (necrosis) of the bowel tissue. Very high-pitched bowel sounds may be a sign of early bowel obstruction.\"\nThe doctor may be unable to hear any bowel sounds when listening to the abdomen which may relate to absent bowel sounds often indicating constipation or a more serious problem of ileus.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/28932#28937", "answerId": "28937"}

Antibiotics like penicillin bind to specific proteins and disrupt their function, in the case of penicillin those are proteins that are responsible for building the cell walls.

Let's look at each in turn.\n\nAre anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming?\n\nYes.\n\nPrevious questions have covered some of the science; see: Is CO2 the cause for Global Warming? , the accepted answer to which explicitly addresses the issue of anthropogenic greenhouse gases; and Do human activities contribute to climate change?\n\nFrom that basis, we know that anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are major contributors to global warming, and that cars are one source.\n\nAre cars a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gases?\n\nYes.\n\nAccording to the World Resources Institute, road transport accounts for 10% of global emissions.\n\nIn the UK, using the figures from the Government's advisory body, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), surface transport accounts for 22% of national emissions, and of that, 60% is from cars: hence 13% (60% x 22%) of national emissions are from cars.  The CCC identifies surface transport as a significant area for attention for two reasons: firstly, its non-negligible 22% contribution to the total; and secondly, that it is a sector where some rapid decarbonisation is possible. In their words, from the source linked at the start of this paragraph:\n\n\n  a 26% reduction in surface transport emissions from 2008 levels is possible by 2020, with a reduction of 44% by 2030\n\n\nThe figures for greenhouse gas emissions include different weightings to reflect the different global warming potential of, for example, methane relative to carbon dioxide. They also include the emissions from livestock.\n\nWould reducing anthropogenic emissions reduce global warming?\n\nYes.\n\nThere are many different emissions scenarios available in the peer-reviewed literature. The IPCC4 summary in 2007 brought together the best available research at the time, and one summary of their different scenarios is available here. The gist reflects that basic underlying physics: higher anthropogenic emissions (scenario A2) means higher temperatures; measures that reduce anthropogenic emissions (scenario B1) will mitigate that, leading to lower temperatures than would otherwise be the case.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8138#8162", "answerId": "8162"}
{"question": "Is eating food with your bare hands more tasty?", "questionId": "31481", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31481", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "There are scientific researches that say that touching (tactile sensations)\n itself, not just the changes in the diffusion of taste and odor compounds with different textures, can adjust the perception of taste and smell. The studies don't specifically say that the taste is always improved but tactile sensations affect the perceived taste. \n\nThere is also difference between the tactile sensation of the fingers and the tactile sensation of the mouth. I tried to include studies that specifically talks about touching with fingers.\n\n\n  Apart from the enjoyment that handling the food with our hands may provide to the eating experience, it is important to note that people can also evaluate a food\u2019s texture (that is, they can gain useful information) using nothing more than haptic information. In one study, for example, Michael Barnett-Cowan [53] had blindfolded participants rate the freshness/staleness and the crispness/softness of a series of pretzels while biting into either the fresh or stale end of a pretzel. Barnett-Cowan manipulated the congruency between the tactile/haptic information provided to the participants\u2019 hand and that provided to their mouth. In half of the trials, the participants were given a half fresh-half stale pretzel (incongruent conditions); whereas in the remainder of the trials, they were given either a whole fresh or stale pretzel (the congruent condition). The results revealed that in the incongruent conditions, the stale part of the pretzel was rated as being significantly fresher and crispier in-mouth because the hands held what felt like a fresh pretzel, and vice versa when holding the stale end. Such results suggest that the perceived texture of food in-mouth can be altered simply by changing the haptic information provided to the consumer\u2019s hands (no matter whether those textural cues are delivered by the food being held in the hand or by the cutlery or plateware if that is held instead).\n  \n  http://www.flavourjournal.com/content/2/1/14\n\n\n\n\n\n  In our paper, we show that the evaluation of taste components can also be influenced by the tactile quality of the food. We first discuss how multisensory factors might influence taste, flavour and smell for both typical and atypical (synaesthetic) populations and we then present two empirical studies showing tactile-taste interactions in the general population.\n  \n  Cross-modal tactile-taste interactions in food evaluations - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26169315\n\n\n\n\n\n  Taste is always accompanied by tactile stimulation, but little is known about how touch interacts with taste. One exception is evidence that taste can be \u201creferred\u201d to nearby tactile stimulation. It was recently found (Lim J, and Green BG. 2007. The psychophysical relationship between bitter taste and burning sensation: evidence of qualitative similarity. Chem Senses. 32:31\u201339) that spatial discrimination of taste was poorer for bitterness than for other tastes when the perceived intensities were matched. We hypothesized that this difference may have been caused by greater referral of bitterness by touch.\n  \n  Tactile Interaction with Taste Localization: Influence of Gustatory Quality and Intensity - http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/2/137.full\n\n\nAdditionally, multiple senses affect the perception of taste as mentioned in many studies. Here is another paper that reviews the impact of perceptual interactions on perceived flavor:\n\n\n  When eating or drinking, the individual experiences a multitude of sensations, including taste, smell, touch, temperature, sight, sound, and sometimes pain/irritation. This multi-faceted sensory experience is the underpinning of perceived flavor, although certainly some sensations contribute more than others.\n  \n  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329303000417\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31481#31492", "answerId": "31492"}

The most glaring is that even though its subtitle is \"The 30 Million Word Gap by Age 3\", the body of the article never actually makes this claim, instead claiming that there is a 32 million gap by age 4. \n\nThe authors of the article gathered data on how many words per hour a child heard through monthly 1-hour observations starting at 7-9 months of age and ending at 33-36 months of age. How and when this observation was conducted is not described. On average during this observation, children in families on welfare heard an average of 616 words while children from professional families heard an average of 2153 words. They assume that children are exposed to the same number of words per hour for 14 hours/day, and conclude that:\n\n\n  In four years of such experience, an\n  average child in a professional family would have accumulated experience with almost\n  45 million words, an average child in a working-class family would have accumulated\n  experience with 26 million words, and an average child in a welfare family would have\n  accumulated experience with 13 million words.\n\n\nThis of course doesn't match the claim in the subtitle (since it refers to age 4). A couple of severe problems in the analysis stand out:\n\n\nThe assumption that children are exposed to the same number of words for 14 hours per day as in the one hour of observation is suspect, and is impossible to evaluate since the conditions of observation are not described.\nPresumably people talk less to babies than to children who can understand them, so extrapolating the constant rate of exposure back to birth is unreasonable.\n\n\nThe math is also a little off: 2153 words/hour for 14 hours a day for 4 years works out to 44.01 million, not 45 million. Based on their numbers and assumptions, the actual word gap by age 3 is 23.6 million words.\n\nThe article also seems to have never been subject to peer review, appearing first in a book by the authors and later being reprinted in the magazine \"American Educator\", published by the American Federation of Teachers.

However, studies have consistently failed to identify a cause-effect relationship between thimerosal and autism. In addition, the prevalence of autism has increased despite a decrease in the thimerosal content of vaccines; this finding further suggests that there is not an association between thimerosal and autism but that the increased prevalence of autism may be attributable to improved diagnostic criteria and increased awareness of autism. Despite failure to demonstrate an association, certain states continue to mandate that vaccines given to children contain no more than trace amounts of thimerosal.\n  \n  Epidemiologic studies continue to provide evidence that there is no association between thimerosal exposure and autism. Whereas an infant younger than 6 months in 1999 could have been exposed to approximately 200 mcg of mercury derived from vaccines, the current amount is less than 3 mcg, if certain influenza vaccines are not included.

The committee concludes that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism.

Well, it seems to be neurotoxic on cell cultures when glutathione levels are low (low glutathione is a common situation in autism):\n\n\n  Because mercury has a high affinity for thiol (sulfhydryl (-SH)) groups, the thiol-containing antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), provides the major intracellular defense against mercury-induced neurotoxicity.

An overdose can cause deep, unresponsive sleep with lowered respiration, but even at high doses it doesn't depress respiration enough to be dangerous (this is distinct from alcohol and opiates, which cause increasing respiratory depression with increasing dosage). Many sources refer to this state as a \"coma,\" but this is either a misunderstanding or deliberate misrepresentation. \n\nAnother potential source of confusion is that GHB is naturally present in the body, and may be produced in large quantities as a protective factor against hypoxia. This means that when an individual dies due to unrelated causes, such as a heart attack, an autopsy may find elevated levels of GHB. I'm convinced that this was what occurred in the case of Hillory Farias, the woman whose death led to the federal ban on GHB even though there was no evidence that she'd actually taken GHB, but this is non-peer-reviewed speculation on my part.\n\nIf you look at human and animal research on GHB that was done before the late 90s, when the media started associating it with drug-war hysteria, you'll see researchers routinely administering doses in the supposedly dangerous 3-5g range with no reports of serious adverse reactions (see below for some examples). Concerns only developed when it was perceived as a \"party drug\" or a \"date-rape drug.\" Since then its Schedule I status has curtailed research, but it continues to be used in research on narcolepsy and reducing the effects of alcohol withdrawal. \n\nOne complication is that GHB can increase the depressant effects of alcohol, leading to potentially fatal alcohol intoxication. This is the likely mechanism behind nearly all reported GHB fatalities.

And that's a relatively fine grained distinction that psychologists have known about.\n\n\nLiterature\n\nTo avoid simply appealing to authority, I'll present a few results from the literature backing up Richard Wiseman's statements.\n\nSuzie Tuffey Riewald, in her series \"Mind Games\" in the NSCA's Performance Training Journal, says:\n\n\n  When mental (cognitive) anxiety tends to be excessive, your goal should be to calm the mind \u2013 effective skills include [...] focusing on process goals (as opposed to outcome goals).\n\n\nPham and Taylor (1999) compared visualizing process vs outcome in the context of exam preparation. \"For 5 to 7 days prior to a midterm\nexamination, college freshmen mentally simulated either the\nprocess for doing well on the exam (good study habits) or\nsimulated a desired outcome (getting a good grade) or both\".\n\nThe results:\n\n\n  [S]tudents who envisioned the steps leading to successful goal achievement performed better on a midterm exam than those who had practiced outcome simulations, which focused them on the outcome they wanted to achieve.\n  \n  The results suggest that envisioning the desired outcome did not prompt effective actions to bring about the desired goal. In fact, outcome simulation can have negative effects on goal-directed behaviour. [...] Outcome simulation participants reported studying 5 hours less, on average, than they had expected to, and they reported striving for a lower grade the day before the exam ...\n\n\nThey say that this matched previous work of Oettingen (1995) that suggested:\n\n\n  Positive fantasies reduce the likelihood of effective action because they produce anticipatory consummation of success and prevent a person from appreciating the effortful actions that are necessary for goal achievement.\n\n\nReferences\n\nOettingen, G.

The evidence establishing sugars as an aetiological factor in dental caries is overwhelming.\n\n\nStudies acknowledge that only extrinsic sugars are implicated in this relationship. (\"Foods rich in starch, without the addition of sugars, play a small\nrole in coronal dental caries\", (Harris et al., citing Moynihan and Petersen 2004)).\n\n\n  The evidence\n  comes from many different types of investigation\n  including human studies (both observational and intervention),\n  human plaque pH studies (in which the pH of\n  plaque is monitored in situ following ingestion of a test\n  substance), enamel slab experiments (in which slabs of\n  bovine enamel are fitted in a removable oral appliance and\n  worn during periods of consumption of experimental diets\n  and subsequently the level of demineralisation is\n  measured), animal studies and incubation studies of oral\n  bacteria and dietary substrates in vitro. (Moynihan and Petersen 2004)\n\n\nBacteria do consume processed sugar. From (Moynihan and Petersen 2004):\n\n\n  Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sorbrinus are important bacteria in the development of dental caries.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  Mutans streptococcal invertase splits sucrose into glucose and fructose, which can be metabolised to produce mainly lactic but also other acids including acetic and formic acid.\n\n\nInterventions\n\nRegarding interventions, the claim that introducing dairy into ones diet is helpful is supported by two studies. \"Milk and cheese can reduce the effects of metabolic acids and help restore enamel lost during eating\" (Harris et al. 2012, citing Aloha et al. 2002 and Kashket et al. 2002).\n\nThe systematic review (Harris et al. 2012) found that:\n\n\nmost of the studies concerning sugar consumption are of relatively weak quality,\nthe evidence for dietary advice aiming to change sugar consumption is poor, and that\nfurther studies in this area should be considered.\n\n\nThis was because there is a dearth of studies examining the advice to change sugar consumption as an intervention and those that do exist have methodological weaknesses. Even though sugar is clearly linked by the evidence through a causal chain to dental cavities, that does not automatically mean that the best (or even useful) intervention is advice to change diet. Possible reasons are poor compliance, improvements masked by simply following toothbrushing advice, etc. The authors conclude that further systematic research needs to be done.\n\n1.

{"question": "Do men feel threatened by intelligent women?", "questionId": "31529", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31529", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "This is the study the article mentions.\n\nDoes the study have those conclusions?\n\nNot really. The experimental results could equally be explained by a simpler conclusion, that people are less likely to ask others out when they feel disappointed, deflated or embarrassed by something (in this case, the public revelation of a poor test result). The researchers acknowledge that such an explanation is potentially valid and supported by prior research on \"affective experience\", and acknowledge this as a limitation. \n\nIt's also just one study, on about 100 U.S. psychology undergraduates, with a systemic bias excluding more intelligent students. It therefore can't be generalized without being replicated on other populations.\n\nHere's an example of the kind of target used by the study:\n\n\n  Seventy-three male undergraduates (Mage = 18.95) participated in a \u201cStudy of Interpersonal Attitudes\u201d in exchange for psychology course credit. \n\n\nAge, field of study and personal maturity are confounding factors on psychological behavior. As such, the news reporting by \"The Independent\" is incorrect and misleading.\n\nIs the study reputable/reliable?\n\nWhile the study is \"serious science\", is being peer-reviewed (or is in pre-print) and is quite interesting, the methodology has systematic bias against intelligent men, and the conclusions are not supported by the experiment set-up: the study merely shows that embarrassing or diminishing people in front of a potential date makes them feel a bit more antagonistic towards her. Likewise, it shows that flattering people in front of a potential date makes them feel more sympathetic and likely to ask them out. As reported, it does not measure anything else.\n\nSystematic bias\n\nThe study in question consists in letting participants take a math test, and then be told that their result was average. \n\n\n  After a few minutes, the experimenter returned with the \n  \u201cgraded\u201d tests and announced their scores while handing \n  back the tests. Participants always got 12/20 questions \n  correct\n\n\nAt the end of the experiment, they were asked whether they believed the results and were discarded if they did not. This is a clear systematic bias because it excludes all candidates that are smart enough to expect a nearly perfect score and know that they can't possibly have an average result.\n\n\n  [P]articipants \n  responded to the following questions in written form: \u201cWhat \n  do you think this experiment was about? Was there anything \n  odd or suspicious about this experiment? If yes, what?\u201d \n  Responses were later coded for whether participants \n  mentioned (a) that their partner was not real or part of the \n  study or (b) thought their test score was fake. Participants \n  who reported suspicion on one or more of these items were \n  excluded from analyses.\n\n\nIn fact, it excluded 10% of the participants.\n\n\n  Participants and Procedure\n  Ninety male undergraduates participated in a \u201cStudy of \n  Interpersonal Attitudes\u201d in exchange for psychology course \n  credit. Nine participants were excluded because they were \n  suspicious of the confederate or did not believe the test \n  feedback; the final sample consisted of 81 participants \n  (Mage = 18.81).\n\n\nValidity\n\nFirst an experiment is set up where the fake results are given in a separate room from the potential date. In this case, performing worse than the date predicts more likelihood to ask the partner out or find them attractive.\n\nSecondly another experiment is set up so that the fake results are given in front of the potential date. In this case, performing better than the date predicts more likelihood to ask the partner out or find them attractive.\n\nI don't see how that supports that \"men are threatened by intelligent women\". It simply shows the obvious result that when someone's ego is boosted by good results they are more optimistic and when their ego is deflated they become timid.\n\nThe authors themselves admit to that, although they simply dismiss this as a \"limitation\".\n\n\n  Previous research suggests that when people interact with \n  a potential partner in a live context (e.g., spatially near \n  context), they rely primarily on their affective experience\u2014\n  positive or negative\u2014to determine their attraction toward \n  the target (Eastwick et al., 2014). In addition, research on \n  SEM suggests that people experience negative feelings \n  (e.g., jealousy) when they are outperformed in a self-\n  relevant domain (Salovey &amp; Rodin, 1984). Together, these \n  two strands of research suggest that men who interacted with \n  a female confederate in the near condition may have felt \n  badly when they were outperformed in a self-relevant domain \n  such as intelligence, and these feelings shaped their evaluations of the confederate. Although we did not measure feelings of jealousy in the present studies, we did assess self-rated \n  masculinity, which produced mixed results.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31529#31530", "answerId": "31530"}

Many present-day psychotherapists still use techniques that bear Freud's imprint, but they have modified the treatment in various ways. The intensity of Freud\n's design has been diminished, Freud insisted on at least three sessions of psychotherapy according to his own psychoanalysis.\n\nAlso, the typical couch on which patients could relax while the psychologist sat outside of the patients' view is no longer used. Modern Neo-Freudian practitioners more commonly known as psychodynamic, ego-analytic and object-relations therapists, emphasize current interpersonal and cultural factors, where classical psychoanalysis emphasizes on past factors mainly.\n\nAnother change in modern psychoanalysis-based therapies is that patients are encouraged to apply what they have learned in their sessions with a therapist, whereas classical psychoanalysis therapy was thought to only be effective if no major life changes were made. (Like getting married, divorced, having children, etc.) So the patients life should be stable during the psychoanalysis therapy.\n\nAlthough psychoanalysis has been the foundation of many therapies that have been scientifically proven to work, it's original form is no longer used in modern day psychological treatments.\n\nSo, concluding, as stated by Scott Mitchell's comment:\n\n\n  Yes, classical Freudian psychoanalysis is pseudoscience, but modern psychoanalytical techniques are evidence-based.

{"question": "Are most adults lactose intolerant?", "questionId": "25318", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/25318", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Yes. Most adults, worldwide, are lactose-intolerant.\n\nI found many papers explaining this, but perhaps the most convincing that I found is this one:\n\n\nA worldwide correlation of lactase persistence phenotype and genotypes\n\n\nFirst, some background:\n\n\n  The ability of adult humans to digest the milk sugar lactose - lactase persistence - is a dominant Mendelian trait that has been a subject of extensive genetic, medical and evolutionary research. Lactase persistence is common in people of European ancestry as well as some African, Middle Eastern and Southern Asian groups, but is rare or absent elsewhere in the world.\n\n\nSo, this has been studied carefully; it isn't just a misunderstanding.\n\nThis paper attempts to identify to what extent the known genetic causes can explain the known differences in prevalence of lactase persistence (i.e. milk tolerance)/\n\n\n  An estimated 65% of human adults (and most adult mammals) downregulate the production of intestinal lactase after weaning. Lactase is necessary for the digestion of lactose, the main carbohydrate in milk, and without it, milk consumption can lead to bloating, flatulence, cramps and nausea. Continued production of lactase throughout adult life (lactase persistence, LP) is a genetically determined trait and is found at moderate to high frequencies in Europeans and some African, Middle Eastern and Southern Asian populations.\n\n\nSo, most adults become incapable of digesting milk as they get older.\n\nThe paper includes a link to a spreadsheet with 227 locations, and the prevalence of lactase persistence, so the raw data is there to check their estimates.\n\nThey also provide a figure (of the \"Old World\" - excluding the Americas) to help you visualise it. (Note: This diagram shows the proportion of people who CAN digest milk.):\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, vast areas of the old world are green and blue - where the majority of adults are lactose intolerant. Nonetheless, larger parts of Europe have a higher prevalence of lactase persistence.\n\nWikipedia explains that this understanding has been fairly recent.\n\n\n  until the 1960s, the prevailing assumption in the medical community was that tolerance was the norm and intolerance was either the result of milk allergy, an intestinal pathogen, or else was psychosomatic (it being recognised that some cultures did not practice dairying, and people from those cultures often reacted badly to consuming milk). Two reasons were given for this perception. Firstly, many Western countries have a predominantly European heritage, so have low frequencies of lactose intolerance, and have an extensive cultural history of dairying. Therefore, tolerance actually was the norm in most of the societies investigated by medical researchers at that point. Secondly, within even these societies, lactose intolerance tends to be under-reported: genetically lactase nonpersistent individuals can tolerate varying quantities of lactose before showing symptoms, and their symptoms differ in severity. [...] Subsequent research revealed intolerance was more common globally than lactase persistence\n\n\n\n\nAs to the question about whether lactose intolerance can be interpreted as \"abnormal\", I reject the categorisation as having a moral component that the data cannot support. It is not abnormal to be taller than 6 foot (1.83m), despite that describing a minority of people. It is not abnormal to not be born in Asia, despite that describing a minority of people. It is not abnormal to have a phenotype that allows the production of lactase into adulthood, even if those adults are in the minority.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/25318#25324", "answerId": "25324"}

{"question": "Is rape a crime about violence and power, or a crime of passion?", "questionId": "15293", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/15293", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Groth (1979) originally identified four types of rapists, classifications that were expanded upon by Berger (2000): the power reassurance rapists (compensatory); power assertive rapists (power, impulsive); anger retaliation rapists (power, control); and anger/excitation rapists (sadistic) which is reported here. Research also shows that acquaintance rapists are characterized as coercive, less violent, and less opportunistic when compared to stranger rapists who are more hostile and use more expressive violence (i.e., inflicting pain or injury as the goal itself) toward women.\n\nThe most commonly cited motivational characteristics of sex offenders mentioned here for rape also reflect the same themes as above like that of compensation, impulsion, assertion, retaliation and excitation. Most modern conceptualizations of rape recognize that it involves both aggressive and sexual motives, but theorists generally emphasize one motive and minimize others. Previous research had not focused on rapists\u2019 communication patterns, except for a study conducted by Darke in 1986 that focused only on verbal communication related to humiliation. \n\nThe caring/persuasion/reassurance theme appears to be consistent with behavioral characteristics of rapists in the 'power reassurance rapist' proposed by researchers Douglas &amp; Olshaker in 1998 to be the most common type of rapist. Previous researchers have suggested that this type of rapist generally feels inadequate and compensates for these feelings of inadequacy by sexually assaulting women. Further, it seems that this type of rapist is constantly looking for reassurance of his own power and potency, and may apologize and express concern for his victim. However, this type of behavior serves the rapist's need for reassurance rather than expressing any genuine concern for his victim. Papers by Douglas &amp; Olshaker, 1998 and Hazelwood &amp; Burgess, 1987 provide more insight into this behavior.\n\nThe angry/demeaning/threatening theme was the next most common type of offender communication. However, some of the communication patterns seem to be consistent with the power exploitative rapist, as researchers suggest that this type of rapist is generally concerned with dominating and controlling his victim and using force, threats and humiliation to gain this submission. This theme is also consistent with the crime scene variables of aggression, antisocial behaviour, anger and vindictiveness identified by Knight et al. in 1998.\n\nThe characteristics of sexually nonsadistic rapist group per Massachusetts Treatment Centre Rapist Typology: Version 3 (MTC:R3) classification revealing their primary motivation of rape as sexual release is not exactly known. 'Sexual release' is not a major/minor motivation class for rape referring to studies such as 'Motivational factors in nonincarcerated sexually aggressive men and 'Motives and psychodynamics of self-reported, unincarcerated rapists.\n\nPer a UN study on men and violence in Asia and the Pacific, 70 to 80% of men who indulged in rape reported that their common motivation was related to sexual entitlement which is the men's belief that they have the right to sex regardless of consent.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/15293#28075", "answerId": "28075"}

Soylent's developer might be making weaker claims, for example (and these are my impressions, not direct quotes):\n\n\nI have tried it for some months, 5 days out of 7; it's a fascinating experiment and I feel better than before\nMany people have a very unhealthy diet of regular/normal food: Soylent isn't perfect, but it's better than that\nThis is a great idea in theory, and R&amp;D is worth pursuing.\n\n\n\n\n\"Complete\" is presumably a matter of degree: perhaps it is relatively complete and is presumably not absolutely complete.\n\nTo illustrate what I mean by \"a matter of degree\":\n\n\nHe is young, has been testing for months, thinks his new diet is better for him than his previous one, and doesn't like to bother with preparing food\nI am not so young, have 30 years as an adult of learning to be a vegetarian, and hope to live for decades more\n\n\nMy opinion (\"probably not\") is influenced by the time-scales involved: the length of the test period, the number of self-selected test subjects, and the quality of the testing and documentation.\n\nhttp://discourse.soylent.me/t/whole-foods-versus-soylent/4272 is a discussion with the authors on the topic \"Whole foods versus Soylent\" ... the last entry in that discussion says,\n\n\n  \n    What are the implications for long term health effects for people that consume soylent for an extended period of time?\n  \n  \n  We do not know, but we are going to find out!\n  \n  Soylent, for me, is an experiment, an adventure! I am certain it is healthier than smoking or being obese, so the long term effects can not be that bad. If something does pop up, I will fix it or stop soylent.

{"question": "Can marijuana cause seizures in children?", "questionId": "44167", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44167", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "As @LangLangC found, there is a more recent study also reported by Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital:\n\n\n  Study results showed from January 2000 through June 2017 there were 2,968 ingestions of marijuana by children younger than six years old reported to U.S. poison centers. The majority (72.4%) of exposures were in children younger than three years old. More than half of all pediatric patients received some form of hospital-based care, of which 7.5% required critical care. Symptoms in patients ranged widely, from drowsiness and confusion to seizures and coma, and required medical treatments including hydration therapy, sedation and intubation.\n\n\nThis would likely be what NBC was reporting as the NBC article dates to June 7, 2019 and the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital article dates to June 6, 2019. The journal article described is here from Pediatric Emergency Care. Quoting from the paper (emphasis added):\n\n\n  Pediatric patients experienced a wide range of symptoms from drowsiness and confusion, to seizures and coma.\n\n\nHenry Spiller also co-authored a 2015 paper that reported on the symptoms of marijuana exposure in children under 6 within the US. The Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital also reported on this study (emphasis added):\n\n\n  The study, published online today in Clinical Pediatrics, found that the rate of marijuana exposure among children 5 years of age and younger rose 147.5 percent from 2006 through 2013 across the United States. The rate increased almost 610 percent during the same period in states that legalized marijuana for medical use before 2000.\n  \n  ...\n  \n  The study findings showed that most exposures resulted in only minor clinical effects, but some children experienced coma, decreased breathing, or seizures. The main psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, THC, can be especially high in marijuana food products, and that may have contributed to some of the observed severe effects. More than 18 percent of children who were exposed were hospitalized. These hospital admissions were likely due not only to the clinical effects, but also the need to investigate the circumstances that lead to the exposure in the home.\n\n\nThe press release says some children experienced seizures, and not most or all. The study is available here.\n\n@LangLangC noted:\n\n\n  The study lists 4 multi-seizures, 6 single seizures in 13 years for 1969 unintentional exposures (ingestion of large amounts) translated to 0.5% percent combined.\n\n\nThus, though not common, seizures have been reported as a symptom of pediatric exposure to marijuana.\n\n\n  Can ingested marijuana cause seizures, specifically in children?\n\n\nYes, ingested marijuana can sometimes cause seizures in children. This is an uncommon symptom of marijuana exposure in children.\n\n\n\nThis said, one of the active compounds in marijuana, cannabidiol, can have positive effects too. In fact, the FDA recently approved a cannabidiol oral solution for the treatment of seizures in \"two rare and severe forms of epilepsy.\" From the packaging insert, this drug is approved for children as young as 2 years old. The results of the clinical trials are an interesting read and are available on page 16 of the insert. Thus, marijuana may also have a preventative effect on seizures. Marijuana is more widely known for causing suicidal thoughts. \u201cThe high prevalence of adolescents consuming cannabis generates a large number of young people who could develop depression and suicidality attributable to cannabis.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the comments, there is some discussion about Henry Spiller's expertise (or lack of) as he is the sole author mentioned in the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital press releases. I would like to point out that as director of an accredited Poison Control Center he may have some expertise the other co-authors of the 2019 paper (all physicians) may not have had, and thus, invited to contribute. It would also be helpful to consider the credentials of the other co-authors before making conclusions about the validity of the paper.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44167#44170", "answerId": "44170"}

{"question": "Does torture work well as an interrogation technique?", "questionId": "4498", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4498", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Short answer: Your friends who think torture is effective at getting reliable information are wrong.\n\nNew Edit/info:  Since this is in the news (December 2014), the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has just recently issued a report (PDF) on torture activities that the US engaged in (the link is the 500 page version). While the majority of details concern specific activities and practices, there are several conclusions that came from this report.  One of the chief findings regarding the effectiveness of torture was that it wasn't, and any instances of it being reported as having played a role were fabrications by the CIA to justify their continued program (findings and conclusions items #1 and #2 as well as #10 stating the dissemination of inaccurate information). Finding and conclusion #8 would even indicate that these actions complicated and impeded US security.\n\nArmy Field Manual 34-52 Chapter 1 says:\n\n\n  \u201cExperience indicates that the use of force is not necessary to gain the cooperation of sources for interrogation. Therefore, the use of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear.\u201d\n\n\nThe C.I.A.\u2019s 1963 interrogation manual stated:\n\n\n  Intense pain is quite likely to produce false confessions, concocted as a means of escaping from distress. A time-consuming delay results, while investigation is conducted and the admissions are proven untrue. During this respite the interrogatee can pull himself together. He may even use the time to think up new, more complex \u2018admissions\u2019 that take still longer to disprove.\n\n\nThe act of torturing can even interfere with a subject's ability to tell the truth.\n\n\n  Solid scientific evidence on how repeated and extreme stress and pain affect memory and executive functions (such as planning or forming intentions) suggests these techniques are unlikely to do anything other than the opposite of that intended by coercive or 'enhanced' interrogation.\n\n\nThis Newsweek article also links to the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience in Dublin that has a paper in the journal Trends in Cognitive Science.  It will cost you nearly $40 for the paper itself though.\n\nIn specifically dealing with the post 9/11 world, a work entitled A utilitarian argument against torture interrogation of terrorists states in its abstract:\n\n\n  Drawing from criminology, organizational theory, social psychology, the historical record, and my interviews with military professionals, I assess the potential of an official U.S. program of torture interrogation from a practical perspective. The central element of program design is a sound causal model relating input to output. I explore three principal models of how torture interrogation leads to truth: the animal instinct model, the cognitive failure model, and the data processing model. These models show why torture interrogation fails overall as a counterterrorist tactic.\n\n\nAnyone remember the Star Trek episode that dealt with this issue?  And this was before Waterboarding was part of our lexicon.\n\nFurthermore, the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues states:\n\n\n  ...there is no evidence that torture is an effective means of gathering reliable information.  Many survivors of torture report they that would have said anything to \u201cmake the torture stop\u201d (Mayer, 2005; McCoy, 2005).  Those who make the claim that \u201ctorture works\u201d offer as evidence only unverifiable anecdotal accounts.\n\n\nLiveScience sums it up very well in the title of an article from October 2007:\n\n\n  Torture Has a Long History ... of Not Working\n\n\nI went through the USAF SERE School, and I can tell you that even though we weren't \"tortured\" we were placed under numerous stressors, and we would do as many deceitful things to get out of those situations as possible (i.e. tell them what they wanted as opposed to the truth).  And we were even taught how to evade the torture by supplying plausible lies, and then \"recover\" from anything that may have been detrimental to our position as a POW.\n\nEDIT TO ADD:  Someone asked if there are any methods for getting information quickly, and reliably.  The answer is, \"It depends.\"  There are many, many techniques out there (Good Cop-Bad Cop, surprise, sympathy, etc.).  All of those really depend on the state of mind of the subject.  One really needs to get to know the subject before you can start to whittle away at them and find what you want/need.  And even then, it is wildly variable and depends a great deal on psychology.  The link to the Army Field Manual 34-52 mentions some specialized training required:\n\n\n  The interrogator requires specialized training in international regulations, security, and neurolinguistics. \n  \n  Neurolinguistics is a behavioral communications model and a set of procedures that improve communication skills. The interrogator should read and react to nonverbal communications. An interrogator can best adapt himself to the source's personality and control his own reactions when he has an understanding of basic psychological factors, traits, attitudes, drives, motivations, and inhibitions.\n\n\nAlso, keep in mind that HUMINT can be gathered much more reliably via other methods than direct interrogation.  The recent example of the courier that led to the raid on Osama bin Laden was all HUMINT gathered via tailing and observation.  DuckMaestro is interested in data, and every source I find says that interrogation isn't even a science, but rather an art...  How is one supposed to get data on that?  A scholarly paper on Police Interrogation techniques, even highlights the art nature more than anything (PDF File).  The most effective that has some backing by studies seems to be the Reid Technique of investigative interviewing, which seems to be a recap from the Army Field Manual.  Also, some folks may be interested in reading about Hanns Scharff, considered one of the most successful interrogators of WW II.\n\n\n  He has been highly praised for the success of his techniques, in particular because he never used physical means to obtain the required information\n\n\nWHY USE IT?  So why do people use it, or promote it?  While probably beyond the scope of the answer, I wanted to address this with a couple of thoughts.  First of all, human beings are animals.  There is a visceral need to hurt your enemy.  If you have captured an enemy, it may seem callous to hurt him for the sake of hurting him, so \"enhanced interrogation\" is a nice rationalization.  And as long as you are told to do so by an authority figure, many people will comply (as also highlighted by the original Milgram Experiment).  Also, many of the proponents for torture have a vested interest in ensuring that it isn't deemed illegal.  They would face prosecution should their actions be deemed illegal!  That is self-preservation.\n\nI will add, torture IS effective at intimidation, and keeping people \"in line\" under an authoritative regime.  In that respect, there is a great deal of historical evidence (recent history like Saddam, Pinochet, Iran; or older history like the Inquisitions or Roman methods).  In that sense, it is a very effective tool, but generally not for the stated purpose of getting reliable information.  But it will get a lot of false confessions that can be used for propaganda and other purposes.  Not only that, some people will indeed give information (as cited in this article), however the overwhelming evidence is again that it may not be reliable, and what have you sacrificed in order to obtain that information?\n\n\n\nINFORMATION BEYOND JUST INITIAL REFUTATION: I just found a HUGE list of quotes as well.  Let me go through them and get a few more for you.  This is a long list of policy quotes, and people involved in the intelligence fields, so it really won't have a lot of actual research citations to back it up, since researching torture is highly unethical.  Although, I think the Stanford Study may be about as close as you can get.  My apologies for some of the references, they aren't always the most impartial, or reliable, so anything below this should probably be taken with a grain of salt.  And of course, should you want to read it all, the inescapable conclusion is that torture does not work as a reliable interrogation technique, and never has.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the CIA\u2019s top spy \u2013 Michael Sulick, head of the CIA\u2019s National Clandestine Service \u2013 said that the spy agency has seen no fall-off in intelligence since waterboarding was banned by the Obama administration. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve suffered at all from an intelligence standpoint.\u201d\n\nThe CIA\u2019s own Inspector General wrote that waterboarding was not \u201cefficacious\u201d in producing information.\n\nA 30-year veteran of CIA\u2019s operations directorate who rose to the most senior managerial ranks (Milton Bearden) says (as quoted by senior CIA agent and Presidential briefer Ray McGovern):\n\n\n  It is irresponsible for any administration not to tell a credible story that would convince critics at home and abroad that this torture has served some useful purpose.  This is not just because the old hands overwhelmingly believe that torture doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it doesn\u2019t \u2014 but also because they know that torture creates more terrorists and fosters more acts of terror than it could possibly neutralize.\n\n\nA former high-level CIA officer (Philip Giraldi) states:\n\n\n  Many governments that have routinely tortured to obtain information have abandoned the practice when they discovered that other approaches actually worked better for extracting information. Israel prohibited torturing Palestinian terrorist suspects in 1999. Even the German Gestapo stopped torturing French resistance captives when it determined that treating prisoners well actually produced more and better intelligence.\n\n\nA retired C.I.A. officer who oversaw the interrogation of a high-level detainee in 2002 (Glenn L. Carle) says:\n\n\n  [Coercive techniques] didn\u2019t provide useful, meaningful, trustworthy information...Everyone was deeply concerned and most felt it was un-American and did not work.\u201d\n\n\nA former top Air Force interrogator who led the team that tracked down Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who has conducted hundreds of interrogations of high ranking Al Qaida members and supervising more than one thousand, and wrote a book called How to Break a Terrorist writes:\n\n\n  As the senior interrogator in Iraq for a task force charged with hunting down Abu Musab Al Zarqawi, the former Al Qaida leader and mass murderer, I listened time and time again to captured foreign fighters cite the torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo as their main reason for coming to Iraq to fight. Consider that 90 percent of the suicide bombers in Iraq are these foreign fighters and you can easily conclude that we have lost hundreds, if not thousands, of American lives because of our policy of torture and abuse. But that\u2019s only the past.\n  \n  Somewhere in the world there are other young Muslims who have joined Al Qaida because we tortured and abused prisoners. These men will certainly carry out future attacks against Americans, either in Iraq, Afghanistan, or possibly even here. And that\u2019s not to mention numerous other Muslims who support Al Qaida, either financially or in other ways, because they are outraged that the United States tortured and abused Muslim prisoners.\n  \n  In addition, torture and abuse has made us less safe because detainees are less likely to cooperate during interrogations if they don\u2019t trust us. I know from having conducted hundreds of interrogations of high ranking Al Qaida members and supervising more than one thousand, that when a captured Al Qaida member sees us live up to our stated principles they are more willing to negotiate and cooperate with us. When we torture or abuse them, it hardens their resolve and reaffirms why they picked up arms. \n\n\nHe also says:\n\n\n  [Torture is] extremely ineffective, and it\u2019s counter-productive to what we\u2019re trying to accomplish.\n  \n  When we torture somebody, it hardens their resolve ... The information that you get is unreliable. ... And even if you do get reliable information, you\u2019re able to stop a terrorist attack, al Qaeda\u2019s then going to use the fact that we torture people to recruit new members.\n\n\nAnd he repeats:\n\n\n  I learned in Iraq that the No. 1 reason foreign fighters flocked there to fight were the abuses carried out at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\n\n\nHe said last month:\n\n\n  They don\u2019t want to talk about the long term consequences that cost the lives of Americans.... [The way the U.S. treated its prisoners] was al-Qaeda\u2019s number-one recruiting tool and brought in thousands of foreign fighters who killed American soldiers. \n\n\nThe FBI interrogators who actually interviewed some of the 9/11 suspects say torture didn\u2019t work.\n\nAnother FBI interrogator of 9/11 suspects said:\n\n\n  I was in the middle of this, and it\u2019s not true that these [aggressive] techniques were effective.\n\n\nA third former FBI interrogator \u2014 who interrogated Al Qaeda suspects \u2014 says categorically that torture does not help collect intelligence.

Their conclusion is unanimous: not only have coercive methods failed to generate significant and actionable intelligence, they have also caused the squandering of resources on a massive scale through false leads, chimerical plots, and unnecessary safety alerts...Here, they say, far from exposing a deadly plot, all torture did was lead to more torture of his supposed accomplices while also providing some misleading \u201cinformation\u201d that boosted the administration\u2019s argument for invading Iraq. \n\n\nAn Army psychologist \u2013 Major Paul Burney, Army\u2019s Behavior Science Consulting Team psychologist \u2013 said (page 78 &amp; 83):\n\n\n  It was stressed to me time and time again that psychological investigations have proven that harsh interrogations do not work. At best it will get you information that a prisoner thinks you want to hear to make the interrogation stop, but that information is strongly likely to be false.\n  \n  Interrogation techniques that rely on physical or adverse consequences are likely to garner inaccurate information and create an increased level of resistance...There is no evidence that the level of fear or discomfort evoked by a given technique has any consistent correlation to the volume or quality of information obtained.\n\n\nAn expert on resisting torture \u2013 Terrence Russell, JPRA\u2019s manager for research and development and a SERE specialist \u2013 said (page 209):\n\n\n  History has shown us that physical pressures are not effective for compelling an individual to give information or to do something\u2019 and are not effective for gaining accurate, actionable intelligence. \n\n\nOkay, I think that's enough for this answer.

{"question": "Is eating fruits separately/on an empty stomach healthier?", "questionId": "16253", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/16253", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Is eating fruits separately healthier?\n\nThis answer isn't by far exhausting, but from what I've been able to find...\n\nProbably not.\n\n\n\nArguments\n\nLet's try to break down the individual claims and compare them with actual studies. Because it is hard to find studies specifically on fruits, I used studies that focused on dietary fiber, sugar and/or vitamins \u2013 things fruits are rich in. [1]\n\nDoes mixing fruits with other food slow down gastric emptying?\n\n\n  If you eat fruit close to a meal [...] it's held in the stomach too long\n\n\nI couldn't find any comparison of digest times of \u2018fruit only\u2019 vs. \u2018fruit with other meal\u2019. However, I found a study (Yu K., 2014) which compares digestion of meals with added dietary fiber to those without added fiber. Fiber was served as a drink with 7.5 g of dietary soluble fiber in it, which is slightly more than the amount of fiber found in 11\u20442 medium apple (USDA). The study found an increase in the time it takes before the stomach to empties half its contents from 72 minutes to 86 minutes.\n\nSo while I can't verify the claim that \u201cfruit alone is digested faster than fruit and a meal\u201c (which is probably also true since larger meals generally take longer time to digest), it has been demonstrated that \u201cmeal alone is digested faster than with fruit\u201d.\n\nIs slower gastric emptying a bad thing?\n\nAccording to Nutrition by Erin, (I'm going to paraphrase it a little) the gastric emptying rate varies between people and depends on many factors. It can be too rapid (symptoms include weakness, diarrhea, and lightheadedness after a meal) or too slow (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fullness). If one's emptying rate is too slow, they should logically avoid things that slow it down even further, if one's rate is too fast, they can change their diet to help slow it down \u2013 eg. they can eat high-fiber foods. Otherwise, some variation in emptying rate is natural.\n\n\n  If you eat fruit close to a meal [it] will rot and ferment in the gut.\n\n\nA meta-study by R. H. Hunt, 2015 states: \u201cthe stomach, together with the oesophagus and duodenum, is the least colonised region of the GI tract\u201d, effectively only H. pylori can live in the acidic environment.\n\nWhile there may[1], or may not[2] be a link between slower gastric emptying and H. pylori infection, it is reasoned that the infection causes slower gastric emptying, not the other way round.\n\nIn summary, it seems improbable that prolonged digestion in the stomach of a healthy individual, where no bacterial rotting and fermentation can occur, would cause rotting or fermentation in the intestine.\n\nDoes empty stomach process the fruits better?\n\n\n  When fruits are eaten alone, your stomach can more easily process all of the nutrients, fibre and the simple sugars contained in the fruit.\n\n\nThis is obviously hard to tell, because monitoring the nutrients of a food as it's being digested isn't a very straightforward task that you could do with ultrasound or X-ray. However there doesn't seem to be much reason for the claim to be true.\n\nVitamins: Water-soluble vitamins don't need any acids to disolve, fat-soluble vitamins do need special bile acids, but those are found in the intestine, not stomach. [1]\n\nFiber: Fruits have large amount of water-soluble fiber, higher than vegetable [2], so its digestion should be no problem. Not only that, soluble fiber \u201csoftens stool and helps slow the movement of the digested material through the digestive tract. This increases nutrient absorption and provides a feeling of fullness for a longer period of time, therefore reducing overall calorie intake. Soluble fiber also binds to bile acids in the intestines and promotes their excretion.\u201d[3] Then there is insoluble fiber which can't be digested at all.\n\nSugars: Since the other food probably contains more complex carbohydrates, I don't see why there should be any problem with the digestion of the simple sugars found in the fruit. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that fructose, which had been thought to be processed in liver, is in fact mostly processed in the intestine. Only when the amount of fructose is too large, it is sent to the liver, which might be harmful. Therefore the autor suggests that sugar-rich food should be consumed after a meal, not on an empty stomach. However the study was done on mice and the real consequences aren't exactly well studied, so this might be a bit of a stretch.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile it seems to be true that mixing fruits with other meal prolongs the time that the food spends in one's stomach, there doesn't seem to be anything bad about it.\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n5 Myths About the Best Time to Eat Fruit (and the Truth)\nAll About Absorbtion\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/16253#43309", "answerId": "43309"}

Just because\n  we find it easier to think in a\n  particular way does not mean that it\n  is true in fact. If we look at why\n  religious beliefs and practices\n  persist in societies across the world,\n  we conclude that individuals bound by\n  religious ties might be more likely to\n  cooperate as societies. Interestingly,\n  we found that religion is less likely\n  to thrive in populations living in\n  cities in developed nations where\n  there is already a strong social\n  support network.\u2019\n  - Project Director Justin Barrett, Ph.D.\n  \n  \u2018This project suggests that religion\n  is not just something for a peculiar\n  few to do on Sundays instead of\n  playing golf. We have gathered a body\n  of evidence that suggests that\n  religion is a common fact of human\n  nature across different societies.\n  This suggests that attempts to\n  suppress religion are likely to be\n  short-lived as human thought seems to\n  be rooted to religious concepts, such\n  as the existence of supernatural\n  agents or gods, and the possibility of\n  an afterlife or pre-life.\u2019\n  - Project\n  Co-Director Professor Roger Trigg\n\n\n\n\nReality\n\n  \n\nThe science does not support the conclusion.\n\nGiven Dr. Barrett knows he is...\n\n\n  ...an observant Christian who\n  believes in \u201can all-knowing,\n  all-powerful, perfectly good God who\n  brought the universe into being,\u201d as\n  he wrote in an e-mail message. \u201cI\n  believe that the purpose for people is\n  to love God and love each other.\u201d -\n  nytimes\n\n\nHe must also know this increases the chances his research could be skewed by\nConfirmation bias.  \n\n\n  These intriguing findings would\n  certainly be strengthened by\n  replications with additional stimuli\n  sets, alternative methods, and with\n  different cultural populations. As\n  they stand, they suggest one possible\n  cognitive reason for the culturally\n  widespread existence of religious\n  beliefs in deities that either order\n  or create the natural world: such\n  ideas resonate with an early\n  developing and persistent intuition\n  that the \n  natural world looks\n  purposefully designed.\n  Positing a\n  designer (or designers) fits with our\n  intuitions. - Barrett\n\n\nThere is also the problem of\nBiased interpretation\n\n\n  We are moral realists. Gods, by virtue\n  of having access to the facts of any\n  matter, also know the moral facts of\n  the matter, and (perhaps not\n  surprisingly) tend to see things the\n  way we do. Theists, then, can glibly\n  accept moral realism. Not so for the\n  atheist. Atheists may have\n  approximately the same moral\n  intuitions and behave just as morally\n  as theists, but have some intellectual\n  work to do that the theist has managed\n  to avoid by relying on the authority\n  of the gods. Atheists have this extra\n  work to do in the moral domain, but\n  that does not mean that it cannot be\n  done. - Barrett\n\n\nAnd good old fashioned\nDemonization\n\n\n  Refusing to accept that, in principle,\n  science could ever allow space for\n  non-material, even theistic,\n  explanations demands philosophical\n  argument, not an assertion of the\n  supremacy of science.

I am quoting the answer below:\n\n\n  Just averaging the raw data would give results that are highly dependent on the particular locations (latitude and elevation) and reporting periods of the actual weather stations; such results would mostly reflect those accidental circumstances rather than yield meaningful information about our climate.\n\n\nIn addition, NASA states that their data is homogenised, as @RomaH mentioned, to account for the effect of urban warming in cities. Source\n\n\n  GISS homogenization (urban adjustment)\n  \n  One of the improvements \u2014 introduced in 1998 \u2014 was the implementation of a method to address the problem of urban warming: The urban and peri-urban (i.e., other than rural) stations are adjusted so that their long-term trend matches that of the mean of neighboring rural stations. Urban stations without nearby rural stations are dropped. This preserves local short-term variability without affecting long term trends. Originally, the classification of stations was based on population size near that station; the current analysis uses satellite-observed night lights to determine which stations are located in urban and peri-urban areas.\n\n\nRegarding whether or not that makes Breitbart's argument a valid one, I don't have a definitive answer.

{"question": "Are there negative developmental effects for children given into early childcare?", "questionId": "3201", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3201", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "\n  Are there negative developmental effects?\n\n\nAssuming that childcare has any effect at all (e.g. more socialization, more familiarity with strangers), that same effect could be described as \"negative\" (e.g. less dependent on or 'close' to parents): so, whether any given effect is \"negative\" might be a (hard to quantify) subjective / value judgement.\n\nI expect it also depends on the type of daycare. For example, putting a toddler into an overcrowded warehouse to watch TV isn't the same as putting them into a daycare environment that's richer in various ways (with better teachers, curriculum, socializing activities, teaching materials, etc.): so IMO the question is too broad to be meaningful ... the answer is, \"well it depends on which daycare.\"\n\nYou're talking about daycare's \"opportunity cost\": that by going to daycare children forego the opportunity to spend formative years with their parent[s]. And that depends on whether the parents are available (on whether they're working); and also, partly, on how rich the experience of spending time with them is (whether they're interested, available, educated, educating, etc.): so, the answer is also \"well it also depends on which parents.\"\n\n\n  conservatives advocating incentives for mothers to stay at home and progressives advocating for improving early childcare\n\n\nThat sounds like it might be a political question (not just an educational/developmental question): e.g. motivated by the perceived role of (private) home and family versus (public) state.\n\n\n\nEDIT\n\n\n  suppose that the parents and the childcare educators are both just as qualified in terms of education\n\n\nThe childcare educators might have two or three years of specifically ECE college training (developmental psychology, curriculum planning, etc.); and, 5 to 20 years of teaching experience, of teaching 10 or 20 children each year.\n\nI'm not saying that parents would be less qualified, but their qualifications are normally different (unless they're trained and experienced daycare teachers themselves, which most people aren't).\n\n'At home' and 'at daycare' are also different environments: the daycare has a peer group of 10 or 20 other children in the class (so there's socialization), likely a different time-table, and a different set of physical resources (I'm thinking of having and understanding e.g. the \"Montessori materials\").\n\nI don't think it's sensible or possible to try to narrow the question by assuming that parents and teachers are \"just as qualified\" (i.e. that their 'qualifications' are equivalent).\n\n\n  Is it then problematic that the child in a childcare center has not a single reference person, i.e. today it's Alice, tomorrow it's Bob etc.? This was argued by the conservative part.\n\n\nMy experience with daycares is that there are two or three more or less constant teachers per classroom. There may be some small variation, for example:\n\n\nOne extra teacher for half the day every day, if there are more children in the classroom for one half of the day (e.g. because some children do half-day kindergarten and half-day daycare)\nAn occasional substitute teacher if a principal teacher is temporarily ill (or, for a longer period, on maternity leave)\nAn occasional special-subject teacher (e.g. a visiting musician once a week, or a visit to the local municipal library, for the librarian to read a story) \n\n\nA child is likely then to be with the same two or three teachers for the whole year (and maybe for more than one year in succession).\n\nI'm talking about where the teachers have permanent (and more or less full-time) jobs, and the child is enrolled for every day for the whole year: the child would have a class, and that class would have a regular set of teachers.\n\nI don't know of a situation where there's \"not a single reference person\": IMO there are usually reference people (children and teachers get to know each other within the first week or so), and if there are several reference people (almost always at least two adults per class simultaneously: not 'on successive days', but at the same time) then that's not a bad thing either (people don't usually have political objections to there being more than one parent, for example).\n\nThere is (so I'm told) some bonding (trust, knowledge, affection) which develop between the (regular) teacher and the child (to call the existence of such a relationship \"negative\" would be, IMO, unfortunate, but that's my political opinion).\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3201#3227", "answerId": "3227"}

Indeed, whether it is \"better\" to eat many small meals a day is one of the questions most frequently posed by the lay public. Comparing the potential benefits of nibbling and of gorging has been the focus of much animal and human research, but no clear consensus has emerged (1-7). Simply put, the question of whether there is a health benefit from the consumption of multiple small meals will ultimately depend on how much energy is consumed, as opposed to how often or how regularly one eats. This possibility raises 2 questions. First, is it easier to overeat under a regimen of frequent, irregular meals? Second, how does the pattern of meal consumption affect metabolic health? \n\n\n...\n\n\n  As shown by Farshchi et al, the regular eating frequency was associated with lower reported ad libitum energy intakes and lower fasting total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. In addition, they concluded that the irregular eating frequency may have reduced insulin sensitivity because that pattern was associated with a lower thermic effect of food (TEF), a higher peak insulin concentration, and a larger 3-h area under the curve of postprandial insulin concentrations. One practical limitation of the work by Farshchi et al is that each dietary phase was only 14 d long and thus did not result in large effects (eg, an \u22489% greater peak postprandial insulin concentration and an 8% lower TEF). \n\n\n...\n\n\n  Two last issues raised by Farshchi et al (8) are whether the effects on metabolism of eating regularity are independent of or mediated by energy intake, and, if there are independent effects, what mechanisms contribute to these effects. With respect to insulin resistance, endocrinologists have long known that, when diabetics are hospitalized for observation, they have significant improvements in blood glucose and insulin concentrations\u2014an effect partially caused by the consumption of regular balanced meals (19). Yet the exact mechanism supporting improved insulin response is unknown.\n\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15085170\n\n\n  RESULTS:\n  There were no significant differences in body weight and 3-day mean energy intake between the regular and irregular meal pattern. In the irregular period, the mean energy intake on the day when 9 meals were eaten was significantly greater than when 6 or 3 meals were consumed (P=0.0001). There was no significant difference between the 3 days of the regular meal pattern. Subjective appetite measurement showed no significant differences before and after the test meal in all visits. Fasting RMR showed no significant differences over the experiment. The overall thermic effect of food (TEF) over the 3 h after the test meal was significantly lower after the irregular meal pattern (P=0.003).\n  \n  CONCLUSION:\n  Irregular meal frequency led to a lower postprandial energy expenditure compared with the regular meal frequency, while the mean energy intake was not significantly different between the two. The reduced TEF with the irregular meal frequency may lead to weight gain in the long term.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2173#5904", "answerId": "5904"}

The air friction is quite substantial, the landing velocity, which is reported to be in range 50-200 m/s, is significantly lower than muzzle velocity, which is usually 300-1000 m/s, but the velocity is still high enough to kill.\n\nCelebratory gunfire - plenty of statistics and examples. My favourite: \"every bullet that is fired up, must come down\".\n\n\n  People are injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down. The mortality rate among those struck by falling bullets is about 32%, compared with about 2% to 6% normally associated with gunshot wounds. The higher mortality is related to the higher incidence of head wounds from falling bullets.\n  \n  For example, in one study led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), they found that 80% of celebratory gunfire-related injuries are to the head, feet, and shoulders. In the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, about two people die and about 25 more are injured each year from celebratory gunfire on New Year's Eve, the CDC says. Between the years of 1985 and 1992, doctors at the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, treated some 118 people for random falling-bullet injuries. Thirty-eight Kuwaitis celebrating in 1991 at the end of the Gulf War by firing weapons into the air caused 20 deaths from falling bullets.\n  \n  Firearms expert Julian Hatcher has studied falling bullets and found that on average .30 caliber rounds reach terminal velocities of 300 feet per second (90 m/s) and larger .50 caliber bullets have a terminal velocity of 500 feet per second (150 m/s). A bullet traveling at only 150 feet per second (46 m/s) to 170 feet per second (52 m/s) can easily penetrate human skin and at 200 feet per second (60 m/s), that same bullet can penetrate the skull.  Even a bullet that does not penetrate the skull may still result in an intracranial injury.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/610#638", "answerId": "638"}

What it actually says is this:\n\n\n  In summary, the available evidence does not directly support a role of ASBs in inducing weight gain or metabolic abnormalities but also does not consistently demonstrate that ASBs are effective for weight loss or preventing metabolic abnormalities. Evidence on the impact of ASBs on child health is even more limited and inconclusive than in adults.\n\n\nIn other words, the available evidence doesn't let us tell whether ASBs are good or bad or neutral. (It is unsusprising that a newspaper article reduces this to \"ASBs don't help\".)\n\nIt does not exactly claim that ASBs \"may be as big a part of the obesity problem as the full-sugar versions\", but it does say this:\n\n\n  Far from helping to solve the global obesity crisis, characteristics related to ASB composition (low nutrient density and food additives), consumption patterns (potential promotion of sweet taste preference), and environmental impact (misuse of natural resources, pollution, or ecotoxicity) make them a potential risk factor for highly prevalent chronic diseases.\n\n\nIn other words, ASBs may well do harm (but the article doesn't make any particular claim about the size of that harm relative to whatever good they may turn out to do).\n\nIt does (see above) claim that \"there is no evidence they help people lose weight\". And it does say that one possible mechanism for this is that \"people assume they can eat more because their drinks are low in sugar\", though that isn't the first mechanism the article mentions:\n\n\n  The main proposed mechanisms are that ASBs stimulate sweet taste receptors -- which could theoretically increase appetite, induce preference for sweet taste, and modulate gut hormone secretion -- or result in overconsumption of solid foods due to awareness of the low calorie content of ASBs [33].\n\n\nSo, in answer to the first question (\"is the cited paper correctly reported?\"):\n\n\nThe reporting is about as accurate as newspaper reporting of scientific articles usually is: it isn't altogether wrong but it fails to distinguish between \"there is no evidence for X\" and \"not-X\" and misses out lots of details.\n\n\nSpecifically, it does say that there is no evidence that ASBs help people lose weight, and the mechanism mentioned in the newspaper article is one of the ones it mentions; but it doesn't say anything so definite as that ASBs don't help people lose weight.\n\nPerhaps unusually, the title (\"No evidence sugar-free soft drinks aid weight loss\") appears to be more accurate than the article itself (\"... do not help people lose weight\").\n\n\n\n\nThe second question asked here is: \"Is the paper effectively challenging, correcting or disproving previous science?\" The paper is actually reporting previous science, but one could still ask whether the research it describes overturns previously accepted science. I bet the answer is no, and that there has never been a scientific consensus that ASBs are a big win for health or obesity, but this is not the sort of thing it is easy to find good evidence of. The paper itself certainly makes no claim to be overturning ideas previously thought to have been established by scientific research.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/36556#36575", "answerId": "36575"}

{"question": "Did the British navy fail to take into account the ballistics correction due to Coriolis force during WW1 Falkland Islands battle?", "questionId": "44759", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44759", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "No. It is a complete invention of an urban myth.\n\nUnless anybody produces a Royal Navy document that even does any mention of this influence of Coriolis effect, this seems to be just untrue. A complete fabrication for a good story \u2013 good for teaching physics but very bad history. \n\nIt seems to be an annoying urban myth. The Coriolis effect is present and significant for shots at long ranges and flight duration. But it is not the only factor involved and naval gunners did not rely on tables alone. The Coriolis effect for any gun on any ship at any latitude in any direction is a constant influence on accuracy if shooting continues into the same direction.\n\nFurther, the observations made during peacetime were not made for this range and speed at all. The only time approaching this range was made on the Southern hemisphere en route to the Falklands and the ships involved did a run of gunnery practice the day before the battle. Any systematic error that big as claimed would have surfaced by then and dealt with accordingly.\n\nSuch systematic errors should be quickly spotted and corrected for as long as the targets are still visible, that is: above the horizon if spotting is to be done from the same ship that is firing.\n\nThis myth is entirely absent from all history books I checked on for this battle. It is also missing from German accounts of the events, as evidenced by how German Wikipedia narrates the analysis:\n\n\n  During the battle, the two British battle cruisers fired the considerable quantity of almost 1200 305 mm grenades at the German armoured cruisers, which allows conclusions to be drawn about the training of the operators and the quality of the grenades. However, the Royal Navy did not draw any conclusions from this circumstance until after the Battle of Skagerrak one and a half years later.\n\n\nA more specialised Wiki has its own entry on Coriolis effect and on the page related to the battle puts it this way:\n\n\n  Coriolis Effect\n  An annoying urban legend persists that the Royal Navy's shooting at the Battle of the Falklands was poor due to their equipment applying corrections for Coriolis effect in the wrong direction, as the action was in the southern hemisphere rather than the northern. The truth is, however, that no contemporary aspect of Royal Navy equipment or procedure took Coriolis effect into consideration, an extremely minor deficiency. For, even if the fable were true, if the action took place on a nearly constant bearing, and at a range that changed only slowly, even a blatant mistreatment of Coriolis effect such as its negative consideration would therefore have been a constant error, and one unlikely to be large compared to other factors affecting the proper deflection to use (such as the zig-zagging of a fleeing enemy). This fact implies that the remedy for such a miscue would have been a single spotting correction for deflection which, once made, would counteract the error for the remainder of the action.\n  While I think it likely that later systems of firing incorporated Coriolis corrections, a system lacking such treatment which is designed primarily to bring fire upon a maneuvering enemy is not a sad system by any means. Taken in context, Coriolis errors are a constant source of deflection error and very small in degree. The need to fire repeated salvoes which for many reasons will require spotting to put them onto the target implies that a failure to handle Coriolis effect, or even handle it entirely backwards, would not prevent a shooter from hitting his target in a prolonged engagement.\n\n\nAnd the British Royal Navy summarises, without ever mentioning \"Coriolis\":\n\n\n  System 1914\n  \n  \n  In the year 1914 a high standard of efficiency in the control of fire was attained; the system used was thoroughly understood and there was no lack of confidence in the ability of the fire control system to compete successfully with the accepted standards of range and general battle conditions.\n  Briefly, the rangefinder equipment was used to feed the fire control gear, and the latter was relied upon to furnish the requisite information for successful attack on a moving target. In conjunction with this, the bracket system of spotting was universally used to correct the best mean range into the actual gun range after opening fire.\n  \n  \n  The correction of the remaining factors, such as rate and deflection, was primarily dependent upon observation of fire, although great importance was attached to the use of the fire control gear as a guide.\n  \n  Battle Experience   \n  \n  \n  The earliest engagements of the war gave no cause to suspect that the firing rules were inadequate to deal with battle conditions.\n  The Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914, fought in very low visibility was not of a character to produce any reliable evidence one way or another. It showed, however -\n  The impossibility of taking ranges in low visibility conditions.\n  The action off the Falkland Islands in the same year demonstrated the following:\n  \n  \n  The rangefinder equipment failed to provide much information. (This was chiefly due to the range at which the action was fought, which outclassed the 9-ft rangefinders.)\n  The use of defensive tactics (zigzagging) rendered the control of fire extremely difficult, and placed a high premium on rapidity of fire as soon as the gun range was found.\n  \n  \n  \n  USE OF 100-YARD CORRECTIONS\n  \n  \n  Reports were called for at the end of 1932 regarding the desirability of limiting the occasions on which corrections of 100 yards for range are permissible, in view of the frequent occasions on which range spotting corrections are insufficiently bold.\n  As a result of these reports it was not considered that a case had been made out for altering the existing rules, but it was stressed that control officers must constantly bear in mind the necessity for the use of bold spotting corrections, especially when aircraft are not available for spotting.\n  \u2013\u2013 ADM 186/339 C.B. 3001/1914-36:  Summary\n  Of Progress In Naval Gunnery, 1914-1936, Training And Staff Duties Division, Naval Staff, Admiralty, S.W., December, 1936.\n  \n\n\nIt is curious for the claim to only focus on the battle at the Falklands. As for the previous battle at Coronel, also on the Southern hemisphere, the outcome was similar. And again at Jutland, this time on the supposedly 'correct' hemisphere for correctly calibrated Coriolis compensation: the British range finding and gun aiming was just inferior. (As the German ships had similar conditions, from perfect manoeuvre-like  going over to smoke-induced blindness at high-speed, but remaining at a better hit-rate)\n\nAs books focusing just on that specific battle alone never mention Coriolis effect, a work that analysis just the history of naval gunnery and aiming techniques concludes:\n\n\n  The rangefinder measured the geometric range between shooter and target, which was sometimes called the true range. Given rangefinder errors, this measurement could not be entirely accurate, but it is convenient to identify the rangefinder figure with the actual distance between ship and target. This range was not the same as the gun range, the range to which sights should be set. Gun range took into account the movement of the target while the shell was in the air and even that of the shooter while the shell was in the gun (where it shared the ship\u2019s motion). It thus involved knowledge of how the range was changing: the range rate. The longer the range (ie, the more time the shell spent in the air), the more significant the range rate. At very long range, factors such as the rotation of the earth had to be taken into account. It began to matter that a ship was able to measure her own speed. That was difficult: only in about 1912 did the Royal Navy obtain an electric log (measuring speed). Other navies were probably in about the same position: the Germans license-produced the British log. \n  \n  The British were fairly sure, moreover, that their understanding of gunnery was far in advance of any other navy: in 1906 DNO\u2019s assistant Captain Harding remarked that foreign navies did not yet understand the difference between geometric and gun range. Only recently had British officers realised how important it was to know the geometric range precisely, rather than depend on spotting beginning with an approximate range. Presumably this referred partly to Captain W C Pakenham\u2019s comments during the Russo-Japanese War (Pakenham was Royal Naval attache\u0301 to Japan at the time): \u2018Outside the Service the impossibility of continuous use of the rangefinder and therefore the importance of a knowledge of the rate of change [range rate] is not recognised, consequently the means of its determination are unsought for.\u2019 No one had tried to make a rangefinder record its output automatically, and no one (apart from Pollen, see chapter 2) had realised the importance of using a gyro to eliminate yaw from rangefinder bearing readings. The Germans were probably the most advanced foreign navy at this time. Little was known of their thinking, but the evidence of what they were using (sextants with a few unmodified Barr &amp; Stroud rangefinders) and of articles in their main annual publication, Nauticus, suggested that they were not working along British lines.\n  \n  The range rate\n  Successful gunnery required that the position of the target be projected ahead, ultimately to the moment at which a shell might be expected to hit. To do that, the shooter had to calculate the rates at which the range and bearing of the target changed; they were usually called the range and bearing rates. Calculation was difficult because neither was constant, and because each depended on the other. Alternatively, one might think in terms of the vector (magnitude and direction) pointing from shooter to target. The change in this vector was another vector which might be called the rate vector. It could be expressed as two components, one along the line of fire and one across it. The rate along was usually called the range rate. The rate across was usually called deflection. Its magnitude was the bearing rate multiplied by the range.\n  \n  The Falklands\n  In December 1914 two British battlecruisers fought Admiral Graf von Spee\u2019s Pacific Squadron, which had recently sunk the HMS Good Hope at Coronel. This time visibility was excellent (only in the last hour of the battle did it fall to 15,000 yards), and both squadrons steamed at high speed. Neither British ship had a functioning director or a Dreyer Table. Both ships found their fire control hampered by funnel smoke, so that although her fore conning tower and A turret never lost sight of the enemy, in Invincible the fore top occasionally lost sight, and P, Q, and X turrets were much affected. Rangefinding was very difficult due to the long range, funnel smoke, splashes and spray from the enemy. Rate-keeping was difficult at best, due to the enemy\u2019s zigzagging as well as to the very long range (variations in range were almost undetectable). Gunners found it difficult to stay on a point of aim, sometimes mistaking the target\u2019s bow for her stern. On the other hand, according to prisoners, British shells performed well, penetrating and exploding deep in the ships. Even so, Gneisenau took fifty 12in hits before sinking. It was no great surprise that the British ships used up most of their ammunition: one 12in gun in Inflexible fired 109 rounds (the ship was designed to carry eighty for that gun).\n  \n  To the surprise of the British, von Spee\u2019s ships zigzagged to avoid being hit, even thought that made hits by their own guns unlikely. As crack gunnery ships, the Germans were expected to fire at maximum range, but the actual figure for their 8.2in guns, 16,000 yards, seems to have surprised the British. The Germans straddled (without hitting) at 15,000 yards. The Germans persistently fired salvoes (the British thought, wrongly, that they were using directors), and their direction and fire discipline were excellent. The British were impressed by the effect of plunging shells at such ranges, and by the blast effect of the German fire. The German survivors stressed, and the British noted, that slow British fire made it easier for their own gunlayers. It also made spotting easier, because the British ships were much less completely enveloped in the smoke of their own guns. This may have been the first of many British observations that their firing techniques were far too deliberate.\n   -- Norman Friedman: \"Naval Firepower. Battleship Guns And Gunnery In The Dreadnought Era\", Seaforth Publishing: Barnsley, 2008.\n\n\nFurther reports include \n\n\n  Excessive smoke was not the only cause of the slow, inaccurate gunfire of the battle cruisers. A British officer in the spotting top of Invincible, Lieutenant Commander Hubert Dannreuther, who happened to be a godson of the composer Richard Wagner, found that his excellent, German-made stereoscopic rangefinder was rendered useless not only by smoke, but also by the vibration caused by the ship\u2019s high speed, and by the violent shaking of the mast whenever A turret fired. In Invincible\u2019s P turret, conditions were impossible. The gun layers could see nothing except enemy gun flashes through enveloping clouds of smoke, and every time Q turret, across the deck, fired over them, everyone in P turret was deafened and dazed by the blast. On Inflexible, Lieutenant Commander Rudolf Verner in the battle cruiser\u2019s foretop was almost the only man aboard his ship who could judge the location of the enemy, and he, handicapped by the smoke from the flagship ahead, had great difficulty observing what damage his gunners were causing. [...]  \n  \n  From Invincible\u2019s spotting top, Dannreuther reported, \u201cShe was being torn apart and was blazing and it seemed impossible that anyone could still be alive.\u201d On Inflexible, Verner, astounded by the continuing salvos from the German armored cruisers, ordered his crews to fire \u201crapid independent,\u201d with the result that at one point, P turret had three shells in the air at the same time, all of which were seen to land on or near the target. Yet the German fire continued. \u201cWe were most obviously hitting [Scharnhorst,] but I could not stop her firing. [...] I remember asking my rate operator, \u2018What the devil can we do?\u2019 \u201d[...]\n  \n  There were many reasons for what at first sight seemed inefficient ship handling and inept gunnery in the British squadron. Before the war, few British naval officers had appreciated the inherent inaccuracy of naval guns at long range. The only time that Lieutenant Commander Dannreuther, the gunnery officer of Invincible, had been allowed to fire at ranges in excess of 6,000 yards was during the practice authorized by Sturdee on the way south to the Falklands\u2014and he had been gunnery officer of the battle cruiser since 1912. Nor had peacetime practice disclosed the difficulties of shooting accurately from a rapidly moving platform at a rapidly moving target. Further, no one had considered that when ships were traveling at high speed, the intense vibration created by engines and propellers might rattle and blur the gun layers\u2019 and trainers\u2019 telescopes. Nor had prewar maneuvers revealed the obscuring effects of billowing funnel smoke at high speed. As the war went on, the expected rate of shells fired to hits achieved became 5 percent. That was approximately the ratio in the Falklands, but at this early time in the war, everyone expected better and therefore it seemed a failure.\n   \u2013\u2013 Robert K Massie: \"Castles Of Steel. Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea\", Ballantine Books: New York, 2003.\n\n\nTo correct a few of the invented history details of the physics teacher, the report of a gunnery officer gives:\n\n\n  \n    Primary Control from Fore Top was used throughout. At times the control was very difficult as we were firing down wind the whole time and the view from aloft was much interfered with by gun smoke and funnel smoke. Range Finders were of little use and any form of range finder plotting was impossible owing to the difficulty of observation and high range. \n    \n    In fact as far as this particular action was concerned it would have made no difference if the ship had not had a single Range Finder or Dumaresq or any plotting outfit on board.\n    \n    During the latter part of the action with the Gneisenau (she) continually zig-zagged to try to avoid being hit, altering course every few minutes about two points either side of her normal course. This alteration of course could not be detected by Range Finder or by eye and continual spotting corrections were necessary. The rate being fairly high and changing every few minutes from opening to closing I found the only effective means was to keep the rate at zero and continually spot on the target. By this means we managed to hit her now and again.\n     -- Quoted from Richard Hough: \"Falklands 1914: The Pursuit of Admiral Von Spee\", Periscope Publishing, 2003.\n  \n\n\nAnd finally, the first shots being fired by the British did not land sideways to the target. They were just a bit too short at their maximum range of 16,500 yards:\n\n\n  At 1247hrs, Sturdee hoisted the signal \u2018Engage the enemy\u2019 and eight minutes later Inflexible opened fire with her forward turret, sending two 12in. shells arcing towards Leipzig at a range of 16,500 yards. The shells fell considerably short, but a few minutes later Invincible began her participation in the battle with a salvo that landed a mere thousand yards short of their target and soon the battle cruisers\u2019 gunnery officers, Hubert Dannreuther and Rudolf Verner were calling out near misses as the German light cruiser was straddled by towering waterspouts.\n   \u2013\u2013 Michael McNally: \"Coronel and Falklands 1914, Duel in the South Atlantic\", Campaign 248, Osprey: Oxford, New York, 2012.\n\n\nA similar assessment of the claim is found at The continued badhistory of Neil deGrasse Tyson: This time, it's the slightly esoteric field of WW1 naval fire control.\n\nThe source \n\nThe origin of this myth can be traced back to admitted hearsay by John Littlewood in 1953 (who is \u2013 in non-history science-related papers  even said to have served as a gunner in the war):\n\n\n  I heard an account of the battle of the Falkland Islands  (early in the 1914 war) from an officer who was there. The  German ships were destroyed at extreme range, but it took  a long time and salvos were continually falling 100 yards to  the left. The effect of the rotation of the earth is similar to  'drift' and was similarly incorporated in the gun-sights. \n  But this involved the tacit assumption that Naval battles  take place round about latitude 50 N. The double difference  for 50 S. and extreme range is of the order of 100 yards.     \n  \n  Various attempts of mine to set this in examinations failed. ' I had hoped to draw the criticism of unreality', to which there is the following reply. In 1917-18, a range table was called for, for* the first time, and quickly, for a gun in an aeroplane flying at a fixed height, to fire in all directions. A method existed, based on numerical calculation of the vertically upward and vertically downward trajectories. It happened that within the permissible limits of accuracy the values of A and p could be faked to make A--JU, (and downward trajectory could accordingly be read off from a table of sines, and the range table was in fact made in this way (in about two-thirds 1 the time it would otherwise have taken).\n  \n  I do not deny that the example just given is slightly disreputable...\n  \n  \u2013\u2013 John E Littlewood: \"A Mathematicians Miscellany\", Methuen: London, 1953 (p51). (archive.org)\n\n\nDuring the war\n\n\n  In World War I Littlewood served in the Royal Garrison Artillery. His contributions were highly significant and special allowances were made to keep him happy, such as letting him live with friends in London, and to carry an umbrella when in uniform! Littlewood himself described this war work in 'J E Littlewood, Adventures in ballistics, 1915-1918'. The result was that he improved the accuracy of anti-aircraft range tables and improved the formulae for finding the range, the time of flight and the angle of descent at the end of a trajectory with small elevation.\n  \n  E A Milne has described how Littlewood was able to discover techniques which greatly reduced the amount of work needed for making these accurate calculation of missile trajectories. Trials were conducted to see if the results of Littlewood's predictions held in practice and, Milne writes:-\n  \n  \n    ... to the astonishment and joy of all concerned the observed positions of the shellbursts fell exactly on Littlewood's trajectories, at the correct time-markings, within very small errors of observation.\n  \n  \n  \u2013\u2013 St Andrews Biographies: John Edensor Littlewood\n\n\nThis unreliable anecdote seems from 1953 onwards to gain little traction, but slowly found its way from lectures into mathematics and physics textbooks in the following years.\n\n\n\nModern handbooks of artillery simply state to ignore Coriolis for distances of less than 10\u201320 km \n\n\n  When firing at distances beyond 10 km the Coriolis\u2019 force must be included as its contribution may exceed more than one per cent of the range of the rocket. However, there are no principal difficulties with the inclusion of this force in the equations. The trajectory calculation will consequently depend on the latitude of the firing post and the azimuthal direction of fire.

This is actually not a force at all, but an apparent acceleration caused the Earth\u2019s rotation. The local frame of reference (north, east, south and west) must rotate as the Earth does. The amount of rotation, also known as the earth rate is dependent on the latitude:\n  \n  earth rate = (2\u03c0 radians)/(24 hours) \u00d7 sin(latitude).\n  \n  For example, at 30 N, the earth rate is 0.13 radians/hr (3.6 x 10 rad/sec).\n  \n  As the frame of reference moves under the projectile that is traveling in a straight line, it appears to be deflected in a direction opposite to the rotation of the frame of reference.\n  \n  In the Northern Hemisphere, the trajectory will be deflected to the right. A projectile traveling 1000 m/s due north at latitude 30 N would be accelerated to the right at 0.07 m/s . For a 30 second time-of-flight, corresponding to about 30-km total distance traveled, the projectile would be deflected by about 60 m.

If you read over that article published by NASA, and also the other NASA article it links to, you'll quickly see the Register author drew some hefty/seemingly unsupported conclusions. At no point in either article do they claim we're heading for another Maunder Minimum, so... that's kind of that. We're certainly in a low sunspot cycle; that much is pretty well established. Here are a few diagrams showing that fact from the NASA articles:\n\nSunspot activity over the last 250 years:\n\n\nSunspot predictions for the next decade (the second NASA article talks about how the predictions are made, nice details):\n\n\nAs you can see, NASA isn't really predicting we're heading for another Maunder Minimum.

It's certainly there, but it's also completely unknown if it was correlation or causation (or just dumb random chance). In the Wiki articles on the Maunder Minimum and the LIA, you can see that there definitely seems to be some relationship between lowered solar activity and cooler climatic periods, but no one really understands why. (It looks like the LIA could have happened due to volcanic activity, or even a slowdown of the thermohaline circulation.)\n\nBut what no one seems to have looked at is the relationship between the sunspot cycle and the various cooling periods within the LIA. NASA defines the LIA as:\n\n\n  A cold period that lasted from about A.D. 1550 to about A.D. 1850 in Europe, North America, and Asia. This period was marked by rapid expansion of mountain glaciers, especially in the Alps, Norway, Ireland, and Alaska.

This doesn't happen, and someone would have to have some very serious problems with their entire digestive tract if it did.\n\nThis thinkquest article outlines the process of protein digestion in quite a straightforward manner:\n\n\n  The process of digestion breaks down complex food molecules (such as the protein in steak) that the body cannot readily use into simpler, smaller molecules (amino acids) which the body can absorb and use to fuel other life processes. The digestive tract performs this mission like a machine. Each organ has a specific job and depends on the others to perform properly. In the mouth, initial physical break-down of protein begins. The stomach continues physical break-down and begins chemical break-down by secreting a substance called pepsinogen. It then converts pepsinogen into an enzyme called pepsin. This enzyme starts to break apart the protein into amino acids. Muscles in the stomach walls then move the food into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. The duodenum and pancreas work together to complete the chemical break-down of protein into single amino acid molecules with the help of another enzyme known as trypsin. Finally, the small intestine absorbs the amino acid molecules, allowing them to pass into the bloodstream. The blood then carries the amino acids to the rest of the body to rearrange into human proteins and use in building its structure. Each part of the \"machine\" of digestion must work properly in order for protein to be broken down into useful amino acids. \n\n\nSo, for someone to have undigested protein in their tissues and cells, their stomach, pancreas and small intestine would all have to be functioning very, very abnormally.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6970#7112", "answerId": "7112"}

Brain chemicals show interdependencies much beyond our current understanding, especially with regards to psychological states and conditions. So we cannot answer the question much beyond saying: maybe. But what we can do is evaluate the specific claims the author (Feinstein) makes, and see what the references he is providing for them state.\n\nFeinstein provides two references to studies he interprets as discussing the beneficial effect of \"acupoints\" on brain chemistry.\n\nThe second, Church, D., Yount, G., &amp; Brooks, A. (in press). The effect of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) on stress biochemistry: A randomized controlled trial. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease., is reported to show that \"the treatment significantly reduced cortisol levels\". This is indeed what Church et al. report; cortisol levels fell on average by ~25%. It fell by only ~15% in the alternative treatment group (a therapeutic interview). However, it also fell by 15% in the control (no treatment) group, so basically, they compared \"EFT\" (supposedly similar to \"acupoints\") to something that had no meaningful effect on cortisol. However, in itself, touching leading to cortisol decrease is not surprising, as e.g. massages lead to lowered cortisol levels - by, it seems, on average over 30%.\nFurthermore, cortisol is not a prototypical \"brain chemical\". Its main effect is probably regulating blood sugar, and generally nutrient metabolism. It can be used as an index of stress, but a slight and short-term decrease in cortisol is not necessarily what I'd universally consider a \"desirable change in brain chemistry\". However, it can be a used as a proxy of transient relaxation.\n\nThe first reference is much more vague; Feinstein writes: \n\n\n  Biochemical effects of acupoint stimulation are also being identified, with neurotransmitters, endorphins, and other brain chemicals apparently being influenced by tapping (Ruden, 2005). \n\n\nLooking up Ruden, we find: \n\n\n  we would like to speculate about a potential mechanism for tapping of the fear response\n\n\nAnd that is indeed what he does. Ruden speculates, which is okay, but that's the extent of it. He cites no direct research on the question itself, reports no actual empirical results of direct tests of his ideas. So, \"do acupoints decrease desirable changes in brain chemistry\"? Maybe.\n\nFinally, let it be said that the Feinstein paper presents some truly horrible statistical methods and is an insult to the idea of meta-analysis.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/23408#23409", "answerId": "23409"}

Where Andrew Grimm pointed to a study from 1987 which is widely reported (it's paywalled so I can't check myself) to say that not only do cats survive terminal velocity, but that their chance of survival increase over some shorter distances. That said the actual study cites that the cats falling from buildings had a 90% survival rate (after treatment), but also a lot of injuries. From the abstract:\n\n\n  High-rise syndrome was diagnosed in 132 cats over a 5-month period. The mean age of the cats was 2.7 years. Ninety percent of the cats had some form of thoracic trauma. Of these, 68% had pulmonary contusions and 63% had pneumothorax. Abnormal respiratory patterns were evident clinically in 55%. Other common clinical findings included facial trauma (57%), limb fractures (39%), shock (24%), traumatic luxations (18%), hard palate fractures (17%), hypothermia (17%), and dental fractures (17%). Emergency (life-sustaining) treatment, primarily because of thoracic trauma and shock, was required in 37% of the cats. Nonemergency treatment was required in an additional 30%. The remaining 30% were observed, but did not require treatment. Ninety percent of the treated cats survived.\n\n\nThe Straight Dope details how far the cats fell which mentions terminal velocity:\n\n\n  But here's the weird part. When the vets analyzed the data they found that, as one would expect, the number of broken bones and other injuries increased with the number of stories the cat had fallen \u2014 up to seven stories. Above seven stories, however, the number of injuries per cat sharply declined. In other words, the farther the cat fell, the better its chances of escaping serious injury.\n  \n  The authors explained this seemingly miraculous result by saying that after falling five stories or so the cats reached a terminal velocity \u2014 that is, maximum downward speed \u2014 of 60 miles per hour. Thereafter, they hypothesized, the cats relaxed and spread themselves out like flying squirrels, minimizing injuries. This speculation is now widely accepted as fact.\n\n\nAlthough the Straight Dope is also careful to point out that perhaps the reason why more terminal velocity cats appear to survive is that the one that didn't land so gracefully wasn't brought into the emergency room and as such the statistics could be skewed. \n\nA more recent study from 2004 cites the previous study as well as several others. The cats in this study had a higher survival rate:\n\n\n  High-rise syndrome was more frequent during the warmer period of the year. 96.5% of the presented cats, survived after the fall.\n\n\nIt also go into a rather deep detail on various injuries sustained by the cats in all the studies, also stating cats don't reach terminal velocity until after the 6th floor and reaches the same conclusion as the previous studies:\n\n\n  This substantiates the theory that cats falling at least seven stories flex their limbs so that truncal injuries are more common, while cats falling from distances lower than seven stories extend their limbs, the consequence being a greater incidence of limb fractures.\n\n\nSomewhat interestingly and related it cites a study on high rise syndrome in dogs from 1993 that says dogs cannot survive a fall from more than 6 stories.\n\nIf we want to investigate further perhaps we should ask Disney to record a movie on the life of wild cats.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3430#3431", "answerId": "3431"}

Usually Phillips puts out a press release on such things, which is often better written than the newspaper reporting thereof, but I cannot find their press release for this (2008) poll.\n\n\n\nAlas it seems there's no systematic research on how cultural variations influence the perception of female hair length, so the best I can offer in that respect is some anecdotal evidence, which I may as well pluck from a newspaper:\n\n\n  \"Short hair is still equated with masculinity,\" says Lesnik-Oberstein. \"I have very short hair, and in England I often get mistaken for a man. It happened to me recently with two older ladies who mistook me for a man in the loo and said: 'Sir, this is a ladies' loo' very politely. They were mortified when I told them I was actually a woman. That never happens to me on the continent \u2013 for instance in Germany or Holland, where a lot of these societies are more egalitarian and matriarchal.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis may not be terribly relevant, but I'll still mention that a study on a large sample of people with fetishes and who necessarily discussed their fetishes on-line, found that \ntrichophilia (hair fetish) had a prevalence in this sample of about 7%, which ranked it 4th among body-part fetishes. Of course, this is far from being the prevalence of trichophilia in society/population at large. In comparison, in the same sample 47% had a foot/toes fetish, which was by far the most common body-part fetish. \n\nMy reasoning for looking at this last issue/study is that if there's some preference for some kind of hair in the general population, there are probably some individuals who exhibit it strongly enough to make it a fetish (for them). I'm not convinced that data from this last study is all that good though, because breast or buttocks fetishes were reported much lower (3% and respectively 2%) which seems counterintuitive and probably indicative of a strong selection bias in the sample.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40152#40153", "answerId": "40153"}

Although there is convincing evidence that human drivers can cause regime shifts at local and regional scales, the increasingly invoked concept of planetary scale tipping points in the terrestrial biosphere remains unconfirmed. By evaluating potential mechanisms and drivers, we conclude that spatial heterogeneity in drivers and responses, and lack of strong continental interconnectivity, probably induce relatively smooth changes at the global scale, without an expectation of marked tipping patterns. This implies that identifying critical points along global continua of drivers might be unfeasible and that characterizing global biotic change with single aggregates is inapt.\n\n\nHis argument admits that ecological tipping points can exist in many ecosystems but that the characteristics necessary for a tipping point to exist don't apply to the whole planet:\n\n\n  Tipping points happen when the components of a system respond gradually to an external force until a level of change is reached at which the response becomes non-linear and synergistic. This amplifies the effect of the force and rapidly drives the system into a new state.\n  \n  To respond in this way, systems must meet certain requirements. Either external forces are applied uniformly and each part of the system responds in the same way, or the system must be highly interconnected to allow synergistic responses to emerge. Or both.\n  \n  Do these criteria apply to the biosphere as a whole? I think not. For planetary tipping points to exist, the forces of humanity would need to act uniformly across the planet, all ecosystems would need to respond to them in the same way, and the response would need to be transmitted rapidly across Earth's many ecosystems and continents.\n\n\nThis even applies to climate change:\n\n\n  Even the force of human-induced climate change, so evident across the planet, does not meet these requirements. For example, it warms and dries some regions while cooling and moistening others...\n  \n  ...So there is little chance of anthropogenic climate change leading to a global tipping point in the biosphere. When it comes to other changes, including land use, habitat fragmentation and extinction, the case for a global tipping point is even weaker.\n\n\nIt isn't that the author doesn't think there is a world problem. He does think man is changing the world and often for the worse. But talking in terms of tipping points is neither helpful to the debate not backed by reliable evidence. He argues:\n\n\n  To deny the likelihood of an impending global tipping point is not to deny that we are transforming the biosphere profoundly and permanently in ways that are likely to disgrace us in the eyes of future generations.\n\n\nWe should try to avoid ecological damage by our actions. We should feel as guilty for allowing local ecosystems to degrade as we should about the whole planet.

{"question": "Does working over 40 hours a week make you less productive?", "questionId": "14028", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/14028", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "First it's important to understand broadly what workforce productivity is, please see Wikipedia's page on Workforce productivity\n\n\n  The OECD defines it as \"the ratio of a volume measure of output to a volume measure of input\".1 Volume measures of output are normally gross domestic product (GDP) or gross value added (GVA), expressed at constant prices i.e. adjusted for inflation. The three most commonly used measures of input are:\n\n\nhours worked;\nworkforce jobs; and\nnumber of people in employment.\n\n\nCommonly understood, it's very difficult to imagine that working fewer hours increases productivity. However, the education, health and satisfaction level of workers is also very important. Increases in those levels can make up for fewer hours worked to some degree. When a business would would like to implement these they offer more benefits, industry specific training programs and can make the management process more democratic in certain ways.  \n\nAlso:\n\n\n  recent research has examined why U.S. labor productivity rose during the recent downturn of 2008\u20132009, when U.S. gross domestic product plummeted. \n\n\nLay-offs would be the obvious reasons, but there are other reasons for this and it will be discussed.\n\nThe changes to the 21st century work-force have made highly skilled \"knowledge workers\" more \"productive\" even while working longer hours than 40 hours per week. Factory workers are increasingly skilled workers now, too in Europe; but over-working factory workers may also cause industrial accidents, so it is not only a \"productivity\" issue, as you mention. Factory work is very monotonous, which makes it actually more mentally stressful, which is a major reason why their hours must be kept down to prevent bad quality work.\n\nWorker productivity can be defined in a number of ways. Measurements try to approximate work quality and quantity. One issue that is consistently re-evaluated is whether sleep deprivation or working longer hours causes more medical mistakes (sort of like an industrial accident in principal). \n\"A review of studies concerning effects of sleep deprivation and fatigue on residents' performance.\" Samkoff JS1, Jacques CH.\n\n\n  The data presently available suggest that sleep-deprived or fatigued house officers can compensate for sleep loss in crises or other novel situations. However, sleep-deprived residents may be more prone to errors on routine, repetitive tasks and tasks that require sustained vigilance, which form a substantial portion of residents' workload. The authors concur with the recommendation of the Executive Council of the Association of American Medical Colleges that the total working hours for residents should not exceed 80 hours per week averaged over four weeks. \n\n\nA \"routine paperwork error\" can occasionally be a very serious error as well that might also kill someone, but according these meta analysis is doesn't occur until over 80 hours/week. A mediocre and sleep deprived doctor is however much more productive than no doctor, but a bad doctor can be less productive than no doctor, as their job is to improve your health, not make you sick, in other words. This is a very extreme case, but in general, it shows the principal that as the knowledge level goes up, the more it makes sense to promote long work hours for the profession even if it causes a decline in work quality up to a certain point. I'm setting the point at increased accidents, although Ford in the quote in the question set his at unacceptable rates of unacceptable quality products and one or other would still be most appropriate to any modern factory. \n\nIn regards to other \"knowledge workers\" or office workers, their productivity is as human resources- seen in terms of the annual financial position of the company minus the cost of the workers salaries and benefits. The US department of Labor tracks employment data by full time and part-time workers and tries to keep track how many hours people are working. Since the Great Recession of 2008, there has been more part-time employment and a drop in hours worked hourly. But there is much evidence that many workers, especially the full-time, working greater than 40 hours/ week has been increasing. \n\nThis is a long-term trend that has helped companies to strengthen financial positions through this process, so their workforce is more \"productive\" for them, as defined.\n\nWhy High Earners Work Longer Hours (National Bureau of Economic Research, 2013)\n\n\n  During most of the 1900s, the hours of work declined for most American men. But around 1970, the share of employed men regularly working more than 50 hours per week began to increase. In fact, the share of employed, 25-to-64-year-old men who usually work 50 or more hours per week on their main job rose from 14.7 percent in 1980 to 18.5 percent in 2001. \n\n\nThe linked paper examines some of the reasons for this change and theorizes that much of it has occurred because high income workers make more money in benefits if they work more hours. As suggested before, benefits, training and democratic input are encouraged in companies to increased productivity BUT also usually these accompany more hours worked too. Many more hours in many cases.\n\nSo, the statement \"increasing hours doesnt proportionally increase productivity\" is true for some people and not for others and the law of diminishing returns always applies in all cases. At this time in the US, the number of people who are beneficial for a company working long hours is lower than those that can work roughly 40 hour/ week and be \"productive\" \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/14028#20267", "answerId": "20267"}

This unusual variety came to light that year after George Washington ordered a scorched-earth campaign against Iroquois tribes. While the militia was destroying the food caches of the Iroquois and burning their crops, soldiers came across a field of extra-sweet yellow corn. According to one account, a lieutenant named Richard Bagnal took home some seeds to share with others. Our old-fashioned sweet corn is a direct descendant of these spoils of war. \n  \n  Up until this time, nature had been the primary change agent in remaking corn. Farmers began to play a more active role in the 19th century. In 1836, Noyes Darling, a onetime mayor of New Haven, and a gentleman farmer, was the first to use scientific methods to breed a new variety of corn. His goal was to create a sweet, all-white variety that was \u201cfit for boiling\u201d by mid-July. \n  \n  He succeeded, noting with pride that he had rid sweet corn of \u201cthe disadvantage of being yellow.\u201d \n  \n  The disadvantage of being yellow, we now know, had been an advantage to human health. Corn with deep yellow kernels, including the yellow corn available in our grocery stores, has nearly 60 times more beta-carotene than white corn, valuable because it turns to Vitamin A in the body, which helps vision and the immune system. \n  \n  SUPERSWEET corn, which now outsells all other kinds of corn, was derived from spontaneous mutations that were selected for their high sugar content. In 1959, a geneticist named John Laughnan was studying a handful of mutant kernels and popped a few into his mouth. He was startled by their intense sweetness. Lab tests showed that they were up to 10 times sweeter than ordinary sweet corn.  \n  \n  Mr. Laughnan was not a plant breeder, but he realized at once that this mutant corn would revolutionize the sweet corn industry. He became an entrepreneur overnight and spent years developing commercial varieties of supersweet corn. His first hybrids began to be sold in 1961. \n  \n  Within one generation, the new extra sugary varieties eclipsed old-fashioned sweet corn in the marketplace. Build a sweeter fruit or vegetable \u2014 by any means \u2014 and we will come. Today, most of the fresh corn in our supermarkets is extra-sweet. The kernels are either white, pale yellow, or a combination of the two. The sweetest varieties approach 40 percent sugar, bringing new meaning to the words \u201ccandy corn.\u201d Only a handful of farmers in the United States specialize in multicolored Indian corn, and it is generally sold for seasonal decorations, not food. \n  \n  We\u2019ve reduced the nutrients and increased the sugar and starch content of hundreds of other fruits and vegetables.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3255#32130", "answerId": "32130"}

My delving suggests that this might be a fine line between truth and woo. First, the woo. I have strong suspicious about the following quotes from your provided SOURCE.\n\n\n  Since cats purr when they are severely injured or dying, it has to be survival-related.\n\n\nNot really. See some reasons cats might purr HERE. Note that I said might. It doesn't seem that we really know. Self-healing is speculated, but I followed Wiki's link for that suggestion over HERE to Scientific American and was sorely disappointed. No sources, no specifics cited... it reads like an editorial opinion piece based simply on intuition and speculation.\n\n\n  The type of frequencies that are found in the cat's purr are good for healing muscle, tendon, and ligament injuries, as well as for muscle strengthening and toning. They are good for any type of joint injury, wound healing, reduction of infection and swelling, pain relief, and relief of chronic pulmonary disease.\n\n\nWow. Huge claim and one would think that we'd have heard about it by now if it had such wide effects. My honest thought when reading this is that the same could be said of certain shades of purple quartz -- but only certain shades. Again, no sources whatsoever about how such effects were determined as \"good\" for such illnesses.\n\nSome stats for cat vs. dog lameness and other sicknesses are given (cats come out ahead -- surprise), followed up by this:\n\n\n  This basically says that cats are in fact healthier than dogs are. People like to say, \"Oh, that's just coincidence,\" but it can't be. The odds of its being coincidence are like three billion to one.\n\n\nNo idea where the statistics are coming from. By this reasoning, if we take any species and compare illness rates to another species, should we conclude that all instances in which one does better than another simply cannot be a coincidence? Re. the claim that cat bones heal faster; I could find no such evidence in my searching. Every search phrase returns that site or a copy-cat of it, though.\n\n\n  Animals have so much more than we have. As humans we are limited by what we're able to see, hear, and smell. Our senses are nowhere near as keen as those of a dog or a cat.  You may have seen your own cat at times looking at something you cannot even sense, much less see.  Most humans presume that their cats are just staring into space, but they are tracking something.\n\n\nAgain, we have no idea. A cat literally might be spacing out. We anthropomorphize and pattern-seek out a \"contemplative look\" on their faces and thus assume they must actually be contemplating. Until we rig up some better inter-species communication or analysis techniques for lower animals, we just won't know what a cat/dog is \"thinking.\"\n\nNow, onto the potential truth. First of all, I think this area has been clouded with woo. Note the results for the google phrase, \"using sound waves for healing\". Lots of hinting at \"deeper levels,\" spiritual refreshment, the bringing about of \"oneness\" and the like. See THIS for an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nI did find some references that indicate that audio frequencies may be beneficial for bone growth.\n\n\nHERE is the abstract for a study in which a 1Hz frequency on the tibias of rabbits provided measured improvement in bone strength.\nHERE is Wiki's summary of beneficial results from low frequency ultrasound stimulation of bone and teeth.\nHERE is a 1990 granted patent for bone growth therapy via \"acoustic shock waves.\" Skip down to the bottom of the second to last page and last page for what are called the \"claims.\" These are the directly stated novel inventions being claimed. Note that the treatment requires shock waves powerful enough to cause the bone to bleed in order to stimulate growth.\nHERE is a summary of an experiment to examine ultrasound on animal bones, but no results are provided.\n\n\nSo... what to make of this? It seems that low intensity ultrasound has definite evidence going for it in terms of bone growth stimulation. Also, acoustic shockwaves from the patent are also cited, but my skim showed them referring to frequencies in the ultrasonic range as well (I could have missed something, though).

Diatoms are microscopic organisms with skeletons made of silica, which is chemically the same as sand.  Breathing the dust would be unhealthy, but ingesting it would be harmless.

{"question": "Has the laser at Magurele, Romania reached a tenth of the Sun's power?", "questionId": "43635", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/43635", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "It's possible they are actually talking about the rate of energy given off by the Sun that reaches the Earth.  However, they are not talking about the amount of energy released, but rather the rate of energy released.\n\n\n\nThe \"laser at Magurele, Romania\" is actually part of the Extreme Light Infrastructure, a pan-European research project, described by Wikipedia as\n\n\n  ...a laser facility that aims to host the most intense beamline system worldwide, develop new interdisciplinary research opportunities with light from these lasers and secondary radiation derived from them, and make them available to an international scientific user community.\n\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article, on 13 March 2019, the ELI NP Research Centre, which is the facility located in Magurele, released a communication regarding the results of a demonstration test.\n\n\n  On March 13, 2019, Magurele held the public communication of the ELI-NP high-power laser system test results, which was also a demonstration test, confirming the achievement of the power of 10 [Petawatts].\n\n\nA Petawatt is the equivalent of 1,000,000,000,000,000 (15 zeroes), or 10^15 Watts, as the prefix Peta describes.  Therefore, a 10 Petawatt laser would be a 10x10^15, or 10^16 Watts.\n\n\n\nPer this report from Sandia National Laboratories, they calculate the amount of solar power that reaches the earth's surface as 89,300 Terawatts.  \n\nA Terawatt is the equivalent of 1,000,000,000,000 (12 zeroes) or 10^12 watts.  A Petawatt is equal to 1,000 Terawatts, so you can easily convert between the two by dividing the number of Terawatts by 1,000 to get the number of Petawatts.  Therefore, the amount of solar power hitting the Earth in Petawatts is 89.3 Petawatts.\n\n\n\nDividing the output of the ELI-NP laser test by the energy output of the Sun that reaches the surface of the Earth results in\n\n\n  10 Petawatts / 89.3 Petawatts = 11.198%\n\n\nwhich is approximately 10%.  Note however, that this does not mean that the laser is continuously generating 10% of the sun's energy.  Per the Wikipedia article on Watt\n\n\n  [The Watt] is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second,1 and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer.\n\n\nFurther down, the page has a section on the distinction between \"Watts\" and \"Watt-hours\".\n\n\n  The terms power and energy are frequently confused. Power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed and hence is measured in units (e.g. watts) that represent energy per unit time.\n  \n  For example, when a light bulb with a power rating of 100W is turned on for one hour, the energy used is 100 watt hours (W\u00b7h), 0.1 kilowatt hour, or 360 kJ. This same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5 hours, or a 50-watt bulb for 2 hours. \n  \n  Power stations are rated using units of power, typically megawatts or gigawatts (for example, the Three Gorges Dam is rated at approximately 22 gigawatts). This reflects the maximum power output it can achieve at any point in time. A power station's annual energy output, however, would be recorded using units of energy (not power), typically gigawatt hours. Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt hours for a given period; often a calendar year or financial year. One terawatt hour of energy is equal to a sustained power delivery of one terawatt for one hour, or approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year.\n\n\nTypically, these kinds of experimental lasers are not constantly on, and fire for an extremely short period of time.  Per the article on the National Ignition Facility, a facility with a similar, albeit less powerful laser\n\n\n  NIF aims to create a single 500 terawatt (TW) peak flash of light that reaches the target from numerous directions at the same time, within a few picoseconds.\n\n\nA 10 Petawatt laser fired for a single picosecond would consume\n\n\n  10^16 Watts * (1 / 10^12) seconds = 10,000 Watt-seconds\n  \n  10,000 Watt-seconds / 3,600 (seconds/hour) = 2.78 Watt-hours\n\n\nCompare this number to the energy consumption of the world which was approximately 22 Terawatt-hours in 2017, and the amount of energy consumed by this laser is completely insignificant, accounting for less than a trillionth of the world's energy consumption.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/43635#43636", "answerId": "43636"}

It made a better story that way. Honestly, would writing \"I'm not sure, but maybe...\" every second sentence really have changed anything? And I did say at the start that I was changing or eliding irrelevant details for the sake of the story.\n  \n  Another factor is the context in which this originally appeared. It was posted to the sage-members list, a list for members of SAGE, the System Administrators Guild, in a thread about \"favorite impossible tasks\". That is to say, it was a light-hearted discussion about the impossible tasks that users or management sometimes bring to sysadmins to solve.\n  \n  If I had any notion that this post would be forwarded so widely, I would have added some details to answer the questions of skeptics. But I was posting to a list of colleagues, a good proportion of whom I know personally, and so was tailoring it for an audience inclined to believe me. :-)\n  \n  The story is fun, but the technical details at the end just don't add up.\n  \n  I know. See the answer to the previous question. First and foremost, I was writing a humorous story based on an actual occurence, not a case study, so I wrote only what was required to get the point across. I find I suddenly have great respect for writers who write works based on true stories, as I now know how hard it is to find the balance between verisimilitude and storytelling. And I now know the kind of criticism you open yourself up to when you choose storytelling over verisimilitude. :-)\n  \n  ...\n  \n  That three millisecond time doesn't make sense as the timeout for a connect() call.\n  \n  Yes, I know. And it wasn't the timeout, actually. In the story, I make it sound like it took all of ten minutes from being made aware of the 500-mile email limit and determining a 3 ms light-speed issue. In fact, this took several hours, and quite a bit of detective work. The point is, eventually I came up with that figure, ran units, and gagged on my latte. (I'm fairly certain it was a different latte from the one I started with.) So what, in particular, is your question about the 3 ms figure?\n  \n  Well, to start with, it can't be three milliseconds, because that would only be for the outgoing packet to arrive at its destination. You have to get a response, too, before the timeout will be aborted. Shouldn't it be six milliseconds?\n  \n  Of course. This is one of the details I skipped in the story. It seemed irrelevant, and boring, so I left it out.\n  \n  Actually, shouldn't it be twelve/eighteen/twenty-four milliseconds, to account for the three-way TCP handshake?\n  \n  Maybe. Again, this would be a detail my lost notes would answer. But I think that a connect() timeout would be aborted upon receiving a SYN/ACK packet; I don't think that the whole handshake had to be completed. Even if it did, I eventually would have arrived at the 3 ms figure, however I got to it.\n  \n  Router delays would have been a much greater factor than you admit in the story.\n  \n  Yes, you're probably right. But they are factors I could account for. I'm not certain this is how I did it, but it seems likely I could have pinged the nearest router I could find (such as one at another school at UNC that manged its own network) to find out what sort of delay a router was likely to add. Then I could multiply that by the number of routers to remote destinations. The number was likely to be constant for other East Coast universities. And even if it wasn't, the delay imposed by an additional router would only be on the order of a few hundred microseconds at most, not enough to make a large difference for nearby destinations.\n  \n  The story is cute, but it has a fatal flaw: signals don't travel at lightspeed in copper.\n  \n  That's true, they travel at 3 c / 4 or thereabouts. But the NIC, the campus backbone, and certainly the Internet backbone was all fiber.\n  \n  Ah-hah! But signals don't travel at light speed in fiber, either!\n  \n  You got me. I'm told they travel at from 2 c / 3 (yes, slower than copper) up to a few percent under c depending on a wide variety of factors. But again, this was a factor I could, and did, account for. I recall pinging various destinations and writing down distances versus ping times, and coming up with an empirical \"effective time\" that differed from actual time. This was just another \"irrelevant and boring detail\" to be left out of the story.\n  \n  ...\n  \n  Well, the story still can't be true.\n  \n  Let me ask you a question: regardless of the details, is it possible that a misconfiguration could cause the operational behavior of nearby email being delivered while faraway email was not? I think the answer is yes. In fact, I know the answer is yes, because it happened. But even putting aside my own experience and viewing it as best I can as a skeptical observer, I think the idea is possible, though certainly implausible at first gloss.\n  \n  If you have a question that isn't answered here, go ahead and email me at trey+500mi@lopsa.org. I may put it in the FAQ and credit you.

If animal genetics, health, breed, diet, management, or environment differs, then so will the composition of the milk produced. Source: Organic and Conventional Milk \u2013 Comparing Apples to Apples?\n\n\nMilk and butter quality estimation in terms of its composition is complex since this is affected by various other factors like genetics, raising and lactation stage/season and not only by the feed (pasture/grass fed) of the cows.\n\n\n  The fatty acid levels in milk (even if the ratios are meaningful) do not necessarily have anything to do with organic methods. Milk composition is determined by breeding (genetics), the feed cows consume, how the cow is raised, lactation stage and season. Source: Got (Healthier) Milk? How Activist Scientists And Journalists Bungled Report On Organic Foods\n\n\nEvidence:\n\n\nOrganically produced butter is not found to have a more favourable effect than conventionally produced better on blood cholesterol.\n\n\n\n  The blood cholesterol (especially low density lipoprotein cholesterol) raising effects of butter fat are well established and mainly attributed to its high saturated fatty acid content, but its trans fatty acid content also contributes. Recent research1 has shown that trans vaccenic acid, the trans isomer naturally found in butterfat, raises blood cholesterol as much as industrially produced trans fatty acids. There is no evidence to show that organically produced butter has a more favourable effect on blood cholesterol. Source: Claims of nutritional superiority of organic milk, meat challenged by scientists\n\n\nButter is mostly fat and dairy items highest in fat are noted to be the most concentrated food sources of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic pollutants. It is also advised that moderating consumption of dairy, particularly high-fat varieties will reduce the intake of these PBTs.\n\n\n  The US EPA estimates that approximately 35% of an adult\u2019s daily intake of dioxins is derived from dairy products. The percentage for children is even higher. Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic pollutants (PBTs), including dioxins, bioaccumulate through the food chain and ultimately result in low-level contamination in most animal fats. It is important to understand the PBT levels in milk, as milk fat may be one of the highest dietary sources of PBT exposure. Analysis of milk also allows the opportunity to investigate geographic variability, as milk is produced and distributed on a regional scale. Source: GRASSFED VS. ORGANIC BUTTER, AND WHICH ONE WILL KILL YOU FASTER.\n\n\nGrain-fed cows might be less contaminated by dioxins than grass fed cows.\n\n\n  For terrestrial animals, the intake of vegetation or roughages is considered the most important dioxin exposure factor (Fries 1995a). Feeds derived from seeds contain lower concentrations of dioxins, since the seed is not directly exposed to the air. Ruminants therefore are more vulnerable to dioxin exposure than poultry and swine, as their feed source is predominantly roughage based...Finishing cattle in feedlots is thought to significantly reduce concentrations of dioxins in beef. This is hypothesized to be due to the feeding of a predominantly grain based diet for several months before slaughter (Lorber, et al. 1994). Source: GRASSFED VS. ORGANIC BUTTER, AND WHICH ONE WILL KILL YOU FASTER.\n\n\n\nResearch shows that increasing pasture and forage-based feeds for cows has considerable potential to improve the fatty acid profile of milk and dairy products.\n\n\n\n  The PLOS one study looked at geographical variation in the difference between organic and conventional milk fatty acid content. Northern California was the only region in which there was no significant difference. The authors speculated that this was because conventional farmers in Norther California usually have cows that roam on the pasture and eat grass and legumes. Thus, it appears the differences between organic and conventional milk are primarily due to what the cows were eating rather than the presence or absence of pesticides, antibiotics, GMOs, or hormones. Source: ORGANIC MILK, GRASS-FED COWS AND OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS\n\n\n\nA meta-analytic review of 196 papers of comparison between organic and conventional milk found that organic milk has a better fatty acid composition than conventional milk. \n\n\n\n  It is concluded that organic bovine milk has a more desirable fatty acid composition than conventional milk. Meta-analyses also showed that organic milk has significantly higher \u03b1-tocopherol and Fe, but lower I and Se concentrations. Redundancy analysis of data from a large cross-European milk quality survey indicates that the higher grazing/conserved forage intakes in organic systems were the main reason for milk composition differences.

When they are, most differences are very small indeed.\u201d Prof. Margaret Rayman, Professor of Nutritional Medicine at the University of Surrey, said: Using the figures in the paper, we have calculated that while a glass of full-fat organic milk (200 ml) will give 2% more of the daily requirement for long-chain omega-3 PUFAs (6.4% vs. 4.4%), it will provide 14% less of the adult daily iodine requirement (21.2% vs. 35.2%). This may have implications for public health as milk and dairy products are the main source of iodine in the UK diet and we have shown that iodine deficiency in pregnant women is linked to lower IQ in their children. Prof. Tom Sanders, Professor emeritus of Nutrition and Dietetics at King\u2019s College London, said: The review found milk yield was 23% lower for organic milk and there were some minor differences in fatty acid composition which are more related to the production systems rather than whether they were organic or not. Source: expert reaction to differences between organic and conventional milk and meat\n  \n  Neither milk nor red meat are significant sources of omega-3 fatty acids, and therefore even a 50% relative increase in this small amount likely has few health implications. For example, if you drank a half liter of whole milk every day, consuming grain-fed milk would provide 11% of the recommended daily intake of omega-3, while drinking grass-fed would provide 16%. If you drink 2% or 1% milk the effect is even smaller. Simply put, you are not going to reach your targets of omega-3 by consuming milk.

James Rubin, Jayati Das Munshi and Simon Wessely, Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: A Systematic Review of Provocation Studies\nPsychosomatic Medicine 67:224-232 (2005), doi: 10.1097/\u200b01.psy.0000155664.13300.64\n\nTheir abstract covers the territory very well:\n\n\n  Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess whether people who report hypersensitivity to weak electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are better at detecting EMF under blind or double-blind conditions than nonhypersensitive individuals, and to test whether they respond to the presence of EMF with increased symptom reporting.\n\n\nPerfect - that seems to be directly aimed at your question.\n\n\n  Results: Thirty-one experiments testing 725 \"electromagnetically hypersensitive\" participants were identified. Twenty-four of these found no evidence to support the existence of a biophysical hypersensitivity, whereas 7 reported some supporting evidence. For 2 of these 7, the same research groups subsequently tried and failed to replicate their findings. In 3 more, the positive results appear to be statistical artefacts. The final 2 studies gave mutually incompatible results. Our metaanalyses found no evidence of an improved ability to detect EMF in \"hypersensitive\" participants.\n\n\nI'm not sure where the Real et al study fit in here, but if it gave a positive result, it was in the minority. (Although, it should also be considered by its sample size and methodological strength, which aren't covered by the numbers here.)\n\n\n  Conclusions: The symptoms described by \"electromagnetic hypersensitivity\" sufferers can be severe and are sometimes disabling. However, it has proved difficult to show under blind conditions that exposure to EMF can trigger these symptoms. This suggests that \"electromagnetic hypersensitivity\" is unrelated to the presence of EMF, although more research into this phenomenon is required.\n\n\nSo, nocebo appears to be a plausible explanation.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7626#7627", "answerId": "7627"}

A soft wood or plastic cutting board makes the best surface. And if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user.\n\nKnives should be used only for the purpose intended. Never use good cutlery to cut string or paper - it is an outrage to cut bones or metal with a good blade.\nBlades should never be heated in a flame in an oven. Elevated temperatures will destroy the temper of the steel.\nAfter use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even of stainless steel blades. Although Wusthof-Trident knives can be cycled in a dishwasher, it is not recommended. High water pressure will dull the cutting edges by knocking them again the rack and against other objects.\nFine knives should be carefully stored in their own block, or special vinyl \"roll\" produced by Wusthof for this purpose.\n\n\n\nSource: Wu\u0308sthof brochure, vintage ~1994.

I wanted to try to figure out which one was responsible for the \"patented technology\" claim in the link above. I simply searched the applicant's name and \"battery xtender\" and got it on the first hit: JD Pfeiffer of Quebec, Canada, owns the trademark to Battery Xtender, and his patent application was granted under US Patent #5,543,702 (LINK).\n\nYou can read the patent, which contains circuit diagrams and descriptions of preferred current supplies and test methods to determine when charging is completed.\n\nNow... does it work? I can't be sure without testing one, but one of the requirements for a granted US Patent is utility -- it has to be useful (LINK). A charger that doens't charge is not useful. Assuming the US Patent Office is doing their job, the data provided by the applicant with the application showed that this device was useful!\n\nYou do have to jump through some hoops for this -- charging alkaline batteries requires that they not be depleted. Here's a page from their manual (LINK): \n\n\n\nSo, note that instead of using an alkaline battery until it's dead, one would cut it off about about 1/5 to 1/6 of it's normal life and recharge it. I don't know how long it takes to recharge, but this might amount to having an extra set or two of batteries if one is to keep cycling like this.\n\nWiki has an article HERE about this which references pulsed current for charging; the whole article is quite vague and un-referenced, though. I didn't see anything about pulsing in my read of the Pfeiffer patent.\n\nSo, with the right type of charger, one does appear to be able to recharge alkaline batteries intended for single use if recharged frequently and before draining very much.\n\n\n\nI wish there were more available test data from this device from external users/organizations.

This is an answer on the mathematical aspect of the problem, not covering the interpretation of the quote.\n\n\n  In a simple calculation based on the real month, the moon travels 2152612.27 km around earth in compete round. This distance represents the length of the orbit that the moon takes while a complete round during one month. \n\n\nWrong. According to NASA, the circumference of the orbit of the moon around Earth is 2'413'402.16 km. \n\nNow, how long is a month? A sidereal month is 27.21 days in solar days of 24 h (86'400). Note the definition of a day in the source, which is 86'164 this is also correct, but that's a sidereal day, meaning a day as measured in relation to the positions of the stars and not the sun. \n\n\n  So the distance per year is: 2152612.27 \u00d7 12 = 25831347 km\n  \n  And in one thousand year is: 25831347 \u00d7 1000= 25831347000 km \n\n\nThere's another problem. One year doesn't have 12 months. The Islamic Calendar Year has 355 days. Considering a month of 27.21 days as mentioned above, 1000 years are equal to 13'019 months.\n\nWith this we can calculate the distance the moon travels in 1000 years, which is roughly 28'000'000'000 km. \n\n\n  The cosmic speed = 25831347000 \u00f7 86164 = 299792 km\\ second which is exactly the speed of the light.\n\n\nAssuming this correspond to the distance light will travel in one day, we get a speed of 324'000 km/s which is more than the speed of light (roughly 300'000 km). Using the sidereal day won't help, as this will only make the value bigger. \n\nNow in a lot of the calculations they use the synodic month instead (29.53 days). This will indeed decrease the number of months but this effect will be entirely canceled out as this leads to a proportional increase in the orbit circumference. (One cannot define the month with one definition of the orbit and then use another definition of the day to calculate the distance per day.\n\nIn all three sources they come to the result either by mixing up different definitions of days, orbits and the like and omitting any explanation for it. Or by using overly complicated calculations to an easy problem to hide those errors in a lot of smart looking maths.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20650#20684", "answerId": "20684"}

First, normal adult subjects are able to detect a range\n  of mental states (both basic and complex) from whole facial\n  expressions, showing strong agreement. This replicates our earlier\n  study which used paintings and drawings of whole faces (Baron-Cohen et\n  al., 1996), but shows this ability under tightly controlled,\n  standardized conditions (photographs of the same actress). Second,\n  whilst for basic mental states the whole face provides significantly\n  more information than either the mouth or the eyes, for complex mental\n  states the eyes (but not the mouth) provide as much information as the\n  full face. This may be because complex mental states are not easily\n  expressed just by the mouth, unlike basic ones (happy, sad, etc).\n  These results are consistent with Nummenmaa\u2019s (1964) result, but\n  demonstrate it for a wider set of mental states.

{"question": "Do frozen foods remain safe indefinitely?", "questionId": "31919", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31919", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Evidence:\n\nFreezing at 0 \u00b0F is known to keep food safe by causing microbes to be dormant and prevention of microorganism growth. However, home freezing cannot be trusted  to destroy parasites such as trichina and there are reports of food  contamination from frozen products such as ice cream which had previous pathogen contamination.\n\n\n  Food stored constantly at 0 \u00b0F or below will always be safe. Only the\n  quality suffers with lengthy freezer storage. Freezing keeps food safe by\n  slowing the movement of molecules, causing microbes to enter a dormant\n  stage. Freezing preserves food for extended periods because it prevents\n  the growth of microorganisms that cause both food spoilage and\n  foodborne illness.\n\n\nMeaning:\n\n\nFoods if stored frozen constantly at 0 \u00b0F will stay safe over longer duration of time (i.e. until the defined time it stays frozen) but quality of the food may reduce over time due to the slow deterioration of the food components.\nThe storage time mentioned by the US Department of Agriculture is not viewed by the food industry as \"indefinite\" since the quality of food will also be considered when determining the storage duration.\n\n\n\n  Although freezing can keep food safe for a very long period, the food industry will not label the storage time of frozen food as indefinite. The quality of food also needs to be considered when determining the storage duration. The storage duration for frozen food (usually in terms of months or years) is usually set out as a quality indicator. The duration may be reduced if the freezer temperature cannot reach -18\u00b0C or fluctuates to above -18\u00b0C.\n\n\n\nThawing is a important factor in ensuring safety of frozen foods. Ice cream is an example of a frozen product which is documented to be contaminated by   different bacterial pathogens.  \n\n\n\n  Although the growth of microorganisms is inhibited when frozen, they may not be killed and may become active again when food is thawed. Therefore, food should not be thawed at room temperature because the process will take a long time and microorganisms, including pathogens, can multiply before the food is entirely defrosted. This may render frozen cooked food or frozen ready-to-eat food unsafe and increase the risk of cross-contamination by frozen raw food. \n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31919#31926", "answerId": "31926"}

Human hair is resistant to digestion as well as peristalsis due to its smooth surface. Therefore it accumulates between the mucosal folds of the stomach. Over a period of time, continuous ingestion of hair leads to the impaction of hair together with mucus and food, causing the formation of a trichobezoar. [...] In addition, incidentally, parts of the tail can break off and migrate to the small intestine, causing intestinal obstruction [...] When not recognized, the trichobezoar continues to grow in size and weight due to the continued ingestion of hair. This increases the risk of severe complications, such as gastric mucosal erosion, ulceration and even perforation of the stomach or the small intestine.

Although the observation has been verified, there is no single scientific explanation for the effect.\n\n\nCan hot water freeze faster than cold water?, Monwhea Jeng, University of California, 1998\n\n\n  Hot water can in fact freeze faster than cold water for a wide range of experimental conditions.  This phenomenon is extremely counterintuitive, and surprising even to most scientists, but it is in fact real.  It has been seen and studied in numerous experiments.  While this phenomenon has been known for centuries, and was described by Aristotle, Bacon, and Descartes [1\u20143], it was not introduced to the modern scientific community until 1969, by a Tanzanian high school student named Mpemba. \n\n\nSome suggested reasons given in the paper:\n\n\n  \n  Evaporation \u2014 As the initially warmer water cools to the initial temperature of the initially cooler water, it may lose significant amounts of water to evaporation.  The reduced mass will make it easier for the water to cool and freeze.  Then the initially warmer water can freeze before the initially cooler water, but will make less ice.

The amino-acids constitute the building blocks for many different chemicals made inside the body: in hormones, enzymes, DNA. encoding, RNA. encoding.... they play vital roles in the body's immune system, they constitute the neurotransmitters in the brain, the cortisol which is involved with stress response - in short we know a fair bit about their roles in the body, and the body and mind can't function at full capacity without them.\n\nAbout 500 amino-acids are known. Ref(1)\n\nAltogether there are twenty amino-acids which we need. Of those twenty there are ten which the human body can synthesize, the other ten are only able to be obtained through our diet, these ten are called \"essential amino-acids\".\n\nAnimal proteins contain the amino-acids we can't produce ourselves, these are called complete proteins.\n\nA vegetarian diet would still contain eggs and dairy products which, together with the vegetable proteins would cover the full count of the required ten essential amino-acids.\n\nThe question boils down to: can a vegan diet provide all ten essential amino-acids, if not, what supliments are available? (Which are not of an animal source)\n\nIt appears to be the case that vegetable proteins are on the whole likely to contain these amino acids, but some of them may be present in only small quantities. It is therefore necessary to find a variety of vegetable sources in order to obtain a balanced diet of complete protein.\n\nFrom: vrg.org/nutrition/protein.php\n\n\n  Soybeans, quinoa (a grain), and spinach also are considered high\n  quality protein. Other protein sources of non-animal origin usually\n  have all of the essential amino acids, but the amounts of one or two\n  of these amino acids may be low. For example, grains are lower in\n  lysine (an essential amino acid) and legumes are lower in methionine\n  (another essential amino acid) than those protein sources designated\n  as high quality protein. Frances Moore Lappe, in her book Diet for a Small Planet \n  advocated the combining of a food low in one amino acid\n  with another food containing large amounts of that amino acid. This\n  got to be a very complicated process, with each meal having specific\n  amounts of certain foods in order to be certain of getting a favorable\n  amino acid mix. Many people got discouraged with the complexity of\n  this approach.\n\n\nIt may not always be possible or convenient to eat healthily on a vegan diet, but there are plenty of food supplements containing the individual elements you may need for that hard to get complete diet. Using a search engine to seek: \"vegan amino-acids\" many websites offer individual amino acids and quite a few pharmacies/health and fitness stores in your local town or city probably do the same. They do in mine. It would then be advisable for the individual to ensure that they are buying not only the appropriate supplements, but ones not obtained from animals.\n\nAnyone embarking on a vegan diet would be well advised to seek advice from a dietitian about their specific requirements, particularly regarding feeding expectant mothers, children, young adults, the old and the very active or ill.\n\nRefs:\n1:  Wagner, Ingrid; Musso, Hans (November 1983). \"New Naturally Occurring Amino Acids\".

{"question": "Does learning immediately before going to sleep increase the effect?", "questionId": "7083", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7083", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "The website you quote makes it sound like the subconsciousness is a little man in your brain, with a book of knowledge, reviewing all the material during the night and \"strengthening knowledge without your influence\". Although the website doesn't properly support the idea about how post-training sleep might benefit memory consolidation, it does convey some \"truth\".\n\nGais et al. 1 studied the timing of learning, sleep and subsequent recall, and indeed found that when learning is immediately followed by sleep, this improves subsequent recall as compared to conditions in which learning was followed by wakefulness.\n\nThe task involved learning German words. In the picture below you can see the different conditions that were tested. In the first experiment (A) Gais tested whether sleep following learning or wakefulness following learning enhanced the consolidation of declarative memory (morning vs. evening). When comparing the different conditions, the evening-learning condition revealed a better performance than the morning condition.\n\nTo control for time-of-day effects a second experiment (B) was conducted, consisting of 2 evening conditions. One evening condition where learning was immediately followed by sleep and another evening condition where sleep was postponed until the morning hours. Again results favoured learning when it was immediately followed by sleep. \n\n(source: cshlp.org)  \n\nSome mechanisms by which the role of sleep following learning (and the role of sleep in learning in general) might be explained are \"memory replay\" during sleep (neuronal activity reflecting the learning of a certain task during the day, re-occuring during the night), and/or synaptic downscaling (the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis).\n\n\n  The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis... predicts that sleep may enhance\n  performance by global downscaling...\n\n\nFor more background information read the review of Tononi &amp; Cirello 3, or a recent review by Ribeiro 4.\n\nNow... what about these 15-20 minutes? Well I don't know where this advice comes from and don't know about scientific support for this claim. In the study of Gais the duration of learning (although not exactly mentioned) was \"a few hours\". I would say they are advantages and disadvantages to a learning period of 15-20 minutes as opposed to a longer learning period.\n\n15-20 minutes rehearsal seems ideal in the sense that you'll be focusing on a limited amount of information. Strengthening this limited amount of information might increase their chances of being retained (I think this idea could be integrated with the synaptic downscaling hypothesis). When keeping study time or learning time shorter you might be able to increase focus. Keeping focus for a long time is more difficult and the efficiency by which one learns might decrease. However, you can also choose to learn for a longer time on a limited amount of information, thus increasing repetition and again increasing chances of the information being retained. It more or less depends on how you spend the time learning... \n\nIn addition, the above mentioned claims might depend on what type of information you want to retain. Studies might report contradicting results, depending on what type of material is to be learned. E.g. complex material requires more investment. Also learning requires time... one has to invest in understanding the material and there are different strategies by which one can try to learn material that aren't covered in the studies. \n\nPersonally I believe studies related to learning and sleep are really interesting to decipher what happens to the information we collect during the day. What happens during the part of the day where we are the least conscious of what's happening around us? When it comes to learning in itself however... I think it's more important to think about \"how\" you learn the material and how often you repeat learning the material, than the timing of learning in relation to sleep (e.g. paper on memory retrieval by Karpicke and Blunt 4).\n\n\nGais, S.

Major findings can be summarized as follows: Receiving even a small favor leads to further compliance with requests of the person who provided the favor (Howard, 1995), even when the favor is unsolicited and unexpected (Regan, 1971), and even when a favor-giver is not perceived as likable (Goei, Massi Lindsey, Boster, Skalski, and Bowman, 2003). Receiving a favor in public conditions creates greater compliance than receiving a favor in private conditions (Whatley, Webster, Smith, and Rhodes, 1999). As the amount of time lengthens between the initial favor and the opportunity to reciprocate, the perceived need to reciprocate diminishes (Burger, Horita, Kinoshita, Roberts, and Vera, 1997).\n  Gender as a Moderator of Reciprocal Consumer Behavior\n\n\nAdditionally, DavePHD's comment is also supported by research. Several studies have been done on wine tasting, one of which says:\n\n\n  The results of the current study empirically supported previous experimental evidence that people feel appreciation and a need to reciprocate for what they have received. Therefore, if winery visitors find their experiences at wineries enjoyable, they are likely to develop a sense of gratitude and possibly a sense of obligation to return hospitality provided by the winery personnel. These feelings, in turn, may lead to a perceived need to buy wine or wine souvenirs at the end of their visits. \n  \n  Additionally, the study aimed to investigate whether visitors of smaller and larger groups differ in terms of the amount of money they spend at wineries and with respect to feelings of gratitude and obligation. The results indicated that visitors who travel to wineries in smaller groups feel more grateful to winery personnel and more obliged to buy wine than those visitors who traveled in larger groups. Accordingly, visitors who travel in smaller groups tend to spend more money on wine than larger groups.\n  IMPORTANCE OF WINERY VISITOR GROUP SIZE\n  ON FEELINGS OF GRATITUDE AND OBLIGATION\n\n\nAnd a similar thing happens with pharmacists who receive free samples and other gifts:\n\n\n  A research published in the American Journal of Bioethics in 2003 [18] points out to the fact that physicians prescribe more medication to which they have access to free samples donated by representatives. Massud [15] confirms this finding by affirming that physicians who receive samples prescribe less and less generic medications and consequently contribute to the increase of expenses with medication.\n  Physicians and Conflicts of Interest\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/36683#36687", "answerId": "36687"}

{"question": "Are added nitrates and nitrites in our diet harmful?", "questionId": "8119", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8119", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "First of all, Nitrate and nitrite are considered hazardous, and there are legal limits to their concentration in food and drinking water.\n\nFrom the Institute of Health Sciences, VU University, Amsterdam, Netherlands:\n\n\n  The World Health Organization (WHO) first set an upper limit for\n  nitrate in food in 1962 (4). It was based on a brief report from the\n  US Food and Drug Administration (5), which stated the following:\n  \u201csodium nitrate has been fed to rats at levels up to 10% in the diet\n  for their lifetime. Other than some depression on growth at levels\n  above 1% of nitrate, no adverse effects were noted in these animals.\n  Two dogs were fed 2% sodium nitrate in their diet for a period of 105\n  and 125 days, respectively. No adverse effects were noted\u201d (p 136).\n  The WHO calculated from this that daily intakes of \u2264500 mg of sodium\n  nitrate/kg body weight were harmless to rats and dogs. This figure was\n  divided by 100 to yield an Acceptable Daily Intake for humans of 5 mg\n  sodium nitrate or 3.7 mg nitrate per kg body weight, which equals 222\n  mg for a 60-kg adult. That figure has stood ever since.\n\n\nPutting a limit on that indicates a form of danger.\n\nFurther there's a mention of what can result when consuming nitrates:\n\n\n  It is undisputed that nitrate ingestion widens arteries. Bacteria in\n  the mouth and gut reduce nitrate to nitrite, which is then converted\n  by nitric oxide synthase into the endothelium-derived relaxing factor\n  nitric oxide (2). That is why sublingual nitrate can resolve an\n  episode of angina pectoris.\n\n\nThere are some minor other things discussed in that article, but none are supported very well, but nevertheless good to know.\n\nOn Scientific American, the intake of nitrate has positive results:\n\n\n  The story of nitrate's positive side began in 1994, when Jon Lundberg\n  of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Nigel Benjamin of\n  Peninsula Medical School in Exeter, England, independently observed\n  that the human stomach harbors large amounts of the gas nitric oxide\n  (NO). Lundberg and Benjamin immediately suspected that the gas might\n  be killing germs in the stomach, because nitric oxide, when presented\n  to microbes by white blood cells, weakens them.\n  \n  The question was where the gas was coming from. Nitric oxide performs\n  several vital functions in the body, including dilating blood vessels,\n  and for these activities, a cellular enzyme called nitric oxide\n  synthase extracts the gas molecule from arginine, an amino acid.\n  Chemists have long known another mechanism: at low pH, nitrite (NO2)\n  forms a stew of nitrogen-oxygen compounds, including nitric oxide.\n  Bacteria in the mouth convert nitrate to nitrite, which gets\n  swallowed, so the stomach can naturally produce nitric oxide. If\n  nitric oxide were truly beneficial to the stomach, harmless bacteria\n  feeding on nitrate-rich saliva might have a symbiotic relationship\n  with humans.\n  \n  Benjamin's group confirmed the antimicrobial effect right away by\n  exposing bacteria responsible for stomach infections to stomach acid\n  both alone and mixed with nitrite. Although acid is often thought to\n  be the stomach's main line of defense against invading bugs, the\n  researchers found that E. coli, Salmonella and other bacteria could\n  survive for hours in it, whereas high normal concentrations of nitrite\n  plus acid killed the bacteria in less than an hour. Next, Lundberg and\n  his co-workers placed saliva from people who had ingested nitrate\n  tablets onto the inside surface of the stomachs of rats. The mucous\n  membranes lining their stomachs thickened and received more blood,\n  both of which are important barriers to infection and ulcers. Rats\n  that received nitrate-poor saliva showed no change. Benjamin has also\n  observed that cavity-causing bacteria self-destruct in a high- nitrite\n  environment, suggesting an experiment to see if a high-nitrate diet\n  prevents cavities.\n\n\nIn the article of the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, They also talk about nitrate danger for infants and cancer related problems.\n\nAbout the methaemoglobine with infants.\n\n\n  In every one of the instances in which cyanosis (the clinical symptom\n  of methaemoglobinaemia) developed in infants, the wells were situated\n  near barnyards and pit privies.\u201d There was an absence of\n  methaemoglobinaemia when formula milk replacements  were made with tap\n  water. Re-evaluation of these original studies indicate that cases of\n  methaemoglobinaemia always occurred when wells were contaminated with\n  human or animal excrement and that the well water contained\n  appreciable numbers of bacteria and high concentrations of nitrate\n  (Avery, 1999). This strongly suggests that Methaemoglobinaemia,\n  induced by well water, resulted from the presence of bacteria in the\n  water rather than nitrate per se. A recent interpretation of these early studies is that \n  gastroenteritis resulting from bacteria in the well water stimulated\n  nitric oxide production in the gut and that this reacted with\n  oxyhaemoglobin in blood, converting it into methaemoglobine.\n\n\nAnd secondly, about cancer risks:\n\n\n  About 50 epidemiological studies have been made since 1973 testing the\n  link between nitrate and stomach cancer incidence and mortality in\n  humans, including Forman et al. (1985) and National Academy of\n  Sciences (1981). The Chief Medical Officer in Britain (Acheson, 1985),\n  the Scientific Committee for Food in Europe (European Union, 1995), and\n  the Subcommittee on Nitrate and Nitrite in Drinking Water in the USA\n  (NRC, 1995) all concluded that no convincing link between nitrate and\n  stomach cancer incidence and mortality had been established.\n  \n  A study reported by Al-Dabbagh et al. (1986) compared incidence of\n  cancers between workers in a factory manufacturing nitrate fertilizer\n  (and exposed to a high intake of nitrate through dust) and workers in\n  the locality with comparable  jobs but without the exposure to\n  nitrate. There was no significant difference in cancer incidence\n  between the two groups.\n  \n  Based on the above findings showing no clear association between\n  nitrate in drinking water and the two main health issues  with which\n  it has been linked, some scientists suggest that there is now\n  sufficient evidence for increasing the permitted concentration of\n  nitrate in drinking water without increasing risks to human health.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8119#8136", "answerId": "8136"}

People not familiar with the subject, or who just glance at the chart quickly might conclude that experimental data show essentially no change even though all the climate models are predicting significant temperature increases - which would indicate that global warming isn't really occurring.  This is not what the chart shows.  In fact, Spencer has selected temperature predictions and measurements just for a specific part of the atmosphere, over a specific part of the earth:\n\n\nThe middle of the lower atmosphere (the mid-troposphere)\nNear the equator (between 20 degrees north and south of the equator).\n\n\nHe did not make it clear in the post that he's focusing on this single value.  While people who are knowledgeable in the field will notice what's being plotted, he's implicitly suggesting that predicted temperature increases are consistently much higher than observations, which is not true.

That means he's looking at atmospheric temperatures in a particular range of elevations, within a particular range of latitudes.  Thus, he's ignoring all other temperature predictions and measurements, which present a much different picture as shown in the chart above. \nHe has chosen not to illustrate areas where the consensus model predictions are understating the severity of climate change, for example polar ice melting  or global sea level rise - which are occurring much faster than models predict.\n\n\n \nsource\n\n \nsource (pdf file)\n\n\nHe has used the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 predictions from all the models.

The study says that there are a larger number of correlations between teacher ratings of students in elementary school and scientist ratings of behaviour 40 years later than one might expect through chance alone.\n\nFor example, from the abstract:\n\n\n  Early \u2018\u2018adaptability\u2019\u2019 was associated with\n  cheerful and intellectually curious behavior, early \u2018\u2018impulsivity\u2019\u2019 was associated with later talkativeness and loud speech, and early rated\n  tendencies to \u2018\u2018self-minimize\u2019\u2019 were related to adult expressions of insecurity and humility.\n\n\nYou write: \n\n\n  I understand that the study says that personality can change, but it's hard.\n\n\nThe study does not say that.

This was demonstrated by a statistical analysis that showed the number of correlations was considerably higher than expected by chance alone.\n\nYou write:\n\n\n  Were there any children whose personalities drastically changed?\n\n\nThis contains a fundamental misunderstanding of the research.\n\nFirstly, practically every child has a drastically different personality 40 years later. They are more mature in numerous ways. If you found a 47-year-old with the personality of a 7-year-old, they would likely be in a mental institution.\n\nSecondly, they didn't measure the same things - e.g. \"impulsivity\" was measured as a child, and \"loud speech\" was measured as an adult, and they were found to correlate. This study could not show that personalities were the same even if they were.\n\nThirdly, even the strongest correlations were fairly mild. e.g. one of the strongest correlations was between \"Verbal Fluency\" as a child and \"Shows interest in intellectual/cognitive matters\" as an adult, and it was r=0.30. Without giving a full lecture on how correlation works, an r-value of 0.30 indicates a mild tendency, not a strong prediction.\n\nYou write: \n\n\n  Are there any other studies that conclude differently?\n\n\nI considered editing this question out, because it shows a strong bias.

Given the degree of time and effort invested into the Manhattan Project I would be hard pressed to believe that a second, smaller project was running in parallel to it so if anything was going on, it would have been under the oversight of the Manhattan project. That said though, work was being conducted on a plutonium gun-type nuclear device known as Thin Man and work was abandoned on July 17, 1944 after determining that \"the background fission rate of the plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely the plutonium would predetonate and blow itself apart in the initial forming of a critical mass\" [4] 2\n\nWith regards to the explosion itself, one of the biggest strikes against a nuclear explosion is that the lack of fallout which is a major concern when it comes to surface burst explosions [5]. Given the nature of Port Chicago we can speculate that a surface burst explosion would have been the most likely to occur which would have lead to a significant amount of fallout being generated. Had nuclear material of some sort been involved then we can speculate that someone would have arrived to do extensive testing of the area around Port Chicago, for which no evidence appears to exist.\n\n\n\nThe next strike against things is there don't appear to be any thermal effects [6] visible in the photographs provided in the Wikipedia article and one of the pier itself (above) looks more like the aftermath of a conventional explosion that personally calls to mind photographs I've of the Halifax Explosion, such as the one below. You will not that in the picture of the Port Chicago pier you can still discern where the pier was and there is a considerable amount of rubble around the site, this is not what one would expect given that the equivalent ground zero at Hiroshima was effective laid bare following the detonation. [7]\n\n\n\nIn summary, based apparent lack of fallout and thermal effects visible in photographs following the incident, we can conclude that a nuclear explosion was not the cause of the incident. Additionally, based upon the currently accepted historical record and the declassified documents currently available, is is quite likely that a nuclear device was not involved with the event.\n\nNotes: \n1. Yes, a number of these sources are Wikipedia; however, it is convenient for timelines and the history of the Manhattan project is considered to be well established.\n2. From a conspiracy theory standpoint, this is a very interesting coincidence and thinking creatively for a moment, an accidental predetonation while a device was in route to test site that was covered up for the war effort is not outside the realm of possibility. The strike against it is that it likely would have been declassified in the intervening years given that the majority of the non-restricted documents from the Manhattan project have been declassified [8].\n\nPhoto Credits: \n1.

It is an important component of cell membranes and a precursor of bile acids, steroid hormones and vitamin D. Contrary to phytosterols (originated from plants), cholesterol is synthesised in the human body in order to maintain a stable pool when dietary intake is low. Given the necessity for cholesterol, very effective intestinal uptake mechanisms and enterohepatic bile acid and cholesterol reabsorption cycles exist; conversely, phytosterols are poorly absorbed and, indeed, rapidly excreted. Dietary cholesterol content does not significantly influence plasma cholesterol values, which are regulated by different genetic and nutritional factors that influence cholesterol absorption or synthesis. Some subjects are hyper-absorbers and others are hyper-responders, which implies new therapeutic issues. Epidemiological data do not support a link between dietary cholesterol and CVD. Recent biological data concerning the effect of dietary cholesterol on LDL receptor-related protein may explain the complexity of the effect of cholesterol on CVD risk.\n\n\nWikipedia on Cholestorol\n\n\n  Most ingested cholesterol is esterified, and esterified cholesterol is poorly absorbed.

Populations that have had historically high carbohydrate intake have not been prone to diabetes so this theory of a high white rice diet is likely incorrect without other factors being present.  The prevalence of diabetes in China in 1980 was estimated at &lt; 1%, 2.5% in 1994, 5.5% in 2001, and 11.6% in 2013 [0] illustrating how dietary changes have impacted on disease prevalence.\n\nIf we look at animal studies where rats are fed high fat diets, we see:[1]\n\n\n  a high-fat diet that raises FFA results in a gradual increase in\n  mitochondria in rat skeletal muscle, with an increase in the capacity\n  for fat oxidation, concomitant with development of muscle insulin\n  resistance.\n\n\nSkeletal muscle insulin resistance then facilitates the development of fatty liver during positive energy balance ( eating too much, not enough exercise ). [2]\n\n\n  Muscle insulin resistance determines the rate at which fatty liver\n  progresses, and ectopic fat deposition in liver and islet underlies\n  the related dynamic defects of hepatic insulin resistance and beta\n  cell dysfunction.\n\n\nThe fatty liver leads to loss of response to insulin so that hepatic synthesis of glucose is no longer suppressed, and the higher levels of glucose induce higher levels of pancreatic insulin release.  The fatty liver also raises plasma triacylglycerols which in turn are toxic to pancreatic beta cells.  The accumulation of triacylglycerols in the pancreas, as well as the circulating high levels cause beta cell dysfunction which then leads to a fall in insulin release, and this allows an even higher rate of hepatic glucose synthesis.\n\nThe rapid restoration of hepatic sensitivity to insulin following gastric bypass surgery shows that the process is potentially reversible in the early stages before permanent pancreatic beta cell failure occurs.\n\n\n\n[0] Xu Y, Wang L, He J, [..], Ning G.

{"question": "Do \"nightshades\" and tomatoes cause inflammation?", "questionId": "31907", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31907", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, and eggplant belong to the same botanical family Solanaceae which is also commonly known as the nightshades. They produce an alkaloid compound called solanine which acts as a nerve poison and serves to defend the plants against pests. Diet has been noted to be linked to circulating inflammation markers through research.\n\nIssue:\n\nDo night shades cause inflammation?\n\nEvidence:\n\n\nTomato: Lycopene found in tomato is noted to down-regulate the inflammatory response. \n\n\n\n  One of the possible mechanisms for its protective activities is by down-regulation of the inflammatory response. That includes the inhibition of pivotal pro-inflammatory mediators, such as the reduction of reactive oxygen species, the inhibition of synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, changes in the expression of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, modifications of eicosanoid synthesis, and modulation of signal transduction pathways, including that of the inducible nitric oxide synthase via its inhibitory effects on Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB), Activated protein-1 (AP-1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Recent data suggest that lycopene also exhibits anti-inflammatory activity through induction of programmed cell death in activated immune cells.\n\n\nVitamin C present in tomato also may have a beneficial effect on inflammation.\n\n\n  Consumption of fruit and vegetables, in general, has been inversely associated with CRP levels and other biomarkers of inflammation. In two small intervention trials, consumption of tomato juice or a tomato-based soft drink was associated with decreased markers of inflammation, but other dietary components of tomatoes besides lycopene, such as vitamin C, may in part be responsible for any beneficial effects on inflammatory processes. \n\n\n\nPeppers: Research shows different varieties of pepper such as Capsicum annuum and Capsicum baccatum contain potential anti-inflammatory compounds which could be tested as future drug candidates for inflammation-related diseases.\n\n\n\n  Capsicum annuum L., a fruit plant from tropical and subtropical regions, contains a range of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds which are known to exhibit a range of bioactivities including free radical scavenging (antioxidant), antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anticancer. This review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the literature published on pharmacological behaviours of C. annuum L.\n\n\n\nPotato: Pigmented potato consumption is noted to reduce inflammation in healthy adult males. Also potato peel extracts are noted to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in vitro.\n\n\n\n  In 2008 and 2009, we received funding from the Maine Agricultural Center to look at a number of differently colored potatoes for total antioxidant activity in the tuber, tuber flesh, and tuber skin. We compared potatoes from tan-skinned, white-fleshed potatoes such as Kennebec, to purple-skinned, purple-fleshed potatoes like Purple Majesty, and we found significant differences in total antioxidant activity among these potatoes. Generally, the more color there was in the potato skin and flesh, the higher the total antioxidant activity. We found more than twice the antioxidant activity in purple potatoes than we found in tan-skinned, white-fleshed potatoes.\n\n\nHowever, the above research should be noted with caution as these findings should not be applied to consumption of French fries and chips which may be the most popular way of consuming potatoes around the world. Chronic ingestion of acrylamide-containing potato products such as fries, chips and cereals is known to induce a proinflammatory state which is a risk factor for progression of atherosclerosis.\n\n\n  It has been shown also that acrylamide increases the production of reactive oxygen species in isolated human monocyte-macrophages in vitro and decreases the cellular glutathione concentration.\n\n\n\nEggplant: Solanum melongena (egg plant) is known to contain a high amount of hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives from corn are noted to have anti-inflammatory activity. However it is not clearly known or tested whether those hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates from egg plants cause anti-inflammatory activity in humans. There are no published research studies testing the effects of eggplant on inflammation in humans.\nMushrooms: The anti-inflammatory effects of edible mushrooms are well researched and the findings are present here and here.\n\n\n\n  Whole mushrooms have a number of components that are potentially immuno-modulatory. Whether the increase is an effect of known immuno-modulatory nutrient components or as a result of bacteria like the psuedomonads that are associated with mushroom cultivation is not known.\n\n\nMeaning:\n\n\nCurrent research evidence does not confirm a definitive link for causation between nightshades and inflammation.\n\n\n\n  For now, there just is not enough quality research to support a link between nightshades and arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. The fruit of these plants have lots of antioxidants that should, if anything, reduce inflammation.\n\n\n\nCertain people might have sensitivity to certain vegetables or fruits based on their body condition or genetics, but this is not a common occurence applied to a general population.\n\n\n\n  Bottom Line: People with arthritis may benefit from nightshades, although some people may have sensitivities to certain vegetables.\n\n\n\nApart from diet, moderate and regular physical activity is known to decrease both acute and chronic inflammation.\n\n\n\n  Animal and human studies have found that various forms of physical activity decrease both acute and chronic inflammation, as measured by reductions in CRP and certain pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, regular physical activity is important in reducing one\u2019s risk for obesity and chronic diseases associated with inflammation. However, excessive exercise can increase systemic inflammation. For example, overtraining syndrome in athletes is associated with systemic inflammation and suppressed immune function \n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/31907#31911", "answerId": "31911"}

As a disclaimer, I don't claim my answer proves dogs can love their owners - but existing evidence seems to suggest they do.\n\nIn order to determine whether dogs can posses deep affection towards their owners, we need to establish whether dogs have such feelings. From this study:\n\n\n  The results suggest that playful,\n  social, exploratory, avoidant and\n  aggressive behaviour in dogs is\n  influenced by stable dispositions;\n  i.e. personality traits, that seem to\n  have been important during the\n  evolution of the domestic dog.\n\n\nIt's behind a pay wall, so unfortunately we cannot scrutinize the methodology, but this study concludes that dogs do have what could be classified as personality traits. If we accept this, then we can safely assume a dog's behavior - more specifically, behaviour identified with affection - can very well be influenced by factors outside the physiological realm.\n\nThen we have this study - it's research subjects are specifically dogs living at rescue centers, so whether it's conclusions can be applied to dogs in general is debatable. However, citing from the abstract:\n\n\n  The specific response of the handled\n  dogs toward the handler fulfilled the\n  operational criteria of attachment. In\n  shelter conditions, the remarkable\n  demand for social contact with humans\n  may result in rather fast forming of\n  attachment even in adult dogs.\n\n\nIn conclusion, existing research seems to corroborate the common sense claims that dogs do develop affection towards their owners. As for how much affection, I doubt research is available. However, anecdotal reports abound, such as the very touching case of Cpl.

So they set out to test whether or not completely other things that caused high pulse, could still trigger that same conditioned connection, and it turned out there was some evidence for that: people who went for a horror film during a date, for instance, tended to rate their date as more attractive than those who had went to a romantic comedy.\n\nOn a similar note, it seems that if you can get people to tell you really personal things (here, experimenters set up \"sharing games\" for the test persons to play during their dates, in which they were encouraged to share increasingly personal information, of the kind you might not otherwise share with a somewhat stranger). Turns out that you're more likely to be attracted to people you've shared very personal information with, and the researchers interpret this as being because you otherwise only share that kind of information with people you're very close to, so since you did, that means you must be close to this person, hey?\n\nIn speed dating (which would probably transfer to any dating circumstances where you have a limited time to make an impression, such as pub pickup or such), techniques that seemed particularly useful were to mimic (within reason) the other person's body language and expressions, and to get them to talk as much as possible about themselves.\n\nSo what have these got to do with The Game? Well, I don't know what the game asserts. If any of the above are mentioned in The Game, then yes, they seem to be vindicated: if not, well, Wiseman is on to some pretty peripheral effects here, and it seems unlikely that he'd miss out on these techniques if there was scientific support for them.

{"question": "Are most of the nutrients of vegetables and fruits contained in the peel?", "questionId": "10169", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10169", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Let's first define \"nutrients\". There are macronutrients and micronutrients. \n\nMacronutrients are the familiar protein (amino acids), carbohydrates (sugars and starches including fiber), fats (saturated/unsaturated/polyunsatured and fatty acids). These are the substances that provide energy and building materials.  An alternative definition of macronutrient is the set of chemical elements we need the most of in large amounts: CHNOPS (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur). Additionally water is an important bulk nutrient. \n\nYou can't survive without macronutrients, and they are undoubtedly \"good stuff\". So in an apple, for example, by far the bulk of the macronutrients are in the flesh and not just the peel: water, sugar, fiber.\n\nMicronutrients are the substances that support specific metabolic functions. These are vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. You can't survive without certain micronutrients, and others while not essential are very healthy (like antioxidants). This is the category that most people mean by \"nutrients\", and what you seem to be asking about in your question.\n\nLet's take a potato as an example. The potato provides many macronutrients throughout, notably starch and water. A 100g potato has 75g of water, 15g of starch. The flesh contains significant amounts of the minerals phosphorus, vitamin C, and potassium. Now -- ounce for ounce, the potato skin does contain more micronutrients than the flesh. But that's ounce for ounce, and the flesh far outweighs the skin. So in a potato as a whole, the majority of nutrients (both macro- and micro-) are in the flesh.\n\nWhich is not to say you should peel them! The real issue is that the skin and the flesh contain different nutrients. \n\nNotice that many fruits and veggies have skins that are more colorful than the flesh - potatoes, apples, pears, peaches, etc. The colors are usually a sign that the skin contains nutritious phytochemicals like carotenoids and flavonoids. Apple skins are red due to the presence of anthocyanins which are not present in the flesh. Anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants. So if you don't eat the apple skin, you don't get the antioxidants. Grape skins contain most of the resveratrol, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, oranges and grapefruits (for example) contain plenty of fantastic nutrients in the juice and flesh - orange peel is good for you, but doesn't contain as many nutrients as the flesh. Blueberries are blue all the way through, and the whole darn fruit flesh-and-skin is rich with nutrients. This is similarly true for tomatoes. \n\nIn summary: in some fruits and vegetables, the skins contain major amounts of certain nutrients, in particular phytochemicals. But it's wrong to say as a blanket statement for all fruits and vegetables that \"most of the nutrients are contained in the peel\".\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10169#10205", "answerId": "10205"}

The \"me\" and \"gay\" pairings could result in anxiety in homophobic men - not because they have homosexual feelings, but because of a fear of being labeled as gay; anxiety has been shown to reduce reaction time. \n\n\n\nThis study by Adams et al concludes:\n\n\n  Both groups exhibited increases in penile circumference to the heterosexual and female homosexual videos. Only the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli. Adams et al, 1996. Is homophobia associated with homosexual arousal? \n\n\nThe exact finding by the numbers:\n\n\n  In the homophobic group, 20% showed no significant tumescence [in response to a male homosexual video], 26% showed moderate tumescence, and 54% showed definite tumescence to the homosexual video; the corresponding percentages in the nonhomophobic group were 66%, 10%, and 24%, respectively. \n\n\nThe paper also notes that this does not necessarily mean that these men are homosexual or bisexual. The reaction could result from negative feelings such as anxiety, which has in the past been shown to cause arousal on its own. \n\n\n\nCheval et al found:\n\n\n  These findings confirm the importance of considering the variability in impulsive processes to understand why some (but not all) men high in homophobia have homosexual interest. These findings reinforce the theoretical basis for elaborating a dual-process model for behaviors in the sexual context.Cheval et al, 2016. Homophobia: An Impulsive Attraction to the Same Sex? Evidence From Eye-Tracking Data in a Picture-Viewing Task.\n\n\n\n\nMeier et al found:\n\n\n  Contrary to the idea that defensive homophobics (i.e., homophobics high in self-deception) harbor an implicit attraction for gay sex, we found that such individuals displayed evidence of a phobic-like aversion. Meier et al, 2006. A secret attraction or defensive loathing? Homophobia, defense, and implicit cognition\n\n\n\n\nMacInnis &amp; Hodson found:\n\n\n  Some theorists propose that homophobia stems from underlying same-sex attraction. A few studies have tested this hypothesis, yet without a clear measure of implicit sexual attraction, producing mixed results. For the first time, we test this attraction-based account of homophobia among both men and women using an implicit measure of sexual attraction. No evidence of an attraction-based account of homophobia emerged. Instead, implicit same-sex attraction was related to positive evaluations of gay men and lesbians among female participants.MacInnis &amp; Hodson, 2013. Is Homophobia Associated with an Implicit Same-Sex Attraction?\n\n\nThe study is behind a paywall, but some details about the methodology and results are available in a Psychology Today article:\n\n\n  ...the authors used an implicit association task (IAT) adapted to sexual attraction: a task in which participants have to categorize pictures as male/female and words as sexually attractive/unattractive, and the speed at which they do so should tell you something about the cognitive association between the two. I'm wary of the interpretations of IATs for a number of reasons, but I'll assume for the time being that such a test does indeed kind of measure what they hope. Participants were also asked about their explicit sexual attractions to men and women, and their attitudes towards gay/lesbian and heterosexual populations. In total, their sample represented 237 Canadian undergraduates (85 men).\n  \n  ...the IAT results only correlated modestly with explicit measures of sexual attraction (r = .37 for men, r = .15 for women). The correlations between those IAT measures and negative, explicit evaluations of homosexuals for men was r = -.06, and for women, r = -.24. In other words, not only were such correlations quite small, but they nominally went in the opposite direction of the repression account: as people showed more implicit attraction to the same sex, they also showed less explicit negativity. \n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/37628#37633", "answerId": "37633"}

Worst case scenario seems to be a catastrophic explosion in one of the reactors housing facilities, destroying the reactor casing and exposing the radioactive material to the atmosphere (I suppose the REAL \"worst case\" would be a very large explosion scatters portions of the core, but I doubt that's possible in this case).  That would increase atmospheric radiation in the local area, probably for a few kilometers.  Radiation outside of the immediate area would likely not be immediately fatal.  This would last until the reactor could be sealed. As evacuations have already begun it seems the personnel at the plant would be the most in danger.  \n\nRealistically it seems there will be a detectable, potentially even dangerous release of radiation.

In fact, the EE form has been used in the majority of cardiovascular-related clinical trials showing benefit of omega-3s, and is the choice for the National Eye Institute\u2019s AREDS 2 trial now in progress.

TG forms of fish oil take longer to react with Styrofoam than EE forms of fish oil. \n\n\n\n  All edible oils, which like Styrofoam\u00ae are non-polar, are made up of fatty acids; and these fatty acids are made up of a long chain of hydrocarbon molecules. With Fish Oils, some contain triglycerides and some contain ethyl esters. Both the triglyceride form and the ethyl ester form first need to be digested and broken down to a free fatty acid for absorption from the GI tract. After uptake, the free fatty acid is then converted to a triglyceride form in the liver by the addition of already available triglycerides obtained from circulating lipids (fats). In the example of fish oils, ALL will react with Styrofoam over time; the length of time is determined by the number of chemical bonds in each type of fish oil relevant to the number of chemical bonds in Styrofoam\u00ae.

As such, it has often been vandalized by generic press, leaving people quite confused on the matter. \n\nThat antioxidants have physiological effects I would say needs no proof: our body utilises antioxidants such as ascorbate (vitamin C) to keep down the amount of free radicals, as can be confirmed by any basic physiology textbook (I can provide references if you need).\n\nTo get to the actual point of your question: do antioxidants have the \"ability to prevent strokes\"? I don't know if the article you read specifically used those words, but this is the type of bad \"generic press talk\" I was referring to...\nAntioxidants do not prevent stroke. You can live a super-healthy life, take tons of antioxidants, exercise every day and still have a stroke. \n\nWhat certain antioxidants can do is to reduce the possibility of having a stroke, which is a very different thing. This is mostly due to the fact that oxidative stress is a risk factor for different cardiovascular diseases.\n\nIn the same line of thought, certain antioxidants, in certain regimes and certain situations can help fighting cancer. They DO NOT CURE cancer by themselves, I cannot stress this enough. Again, the idea is that free radicals can damage DNA increasing the risk of cancer. Free radical do not provoke cancer, but they can be a risk factor.\n\nSame for neurodegenerative diseases and many other illnesses where antioxidants can help in certain cases.\n\nIt is difficult to generalize because stroke, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases are very broad category of illnesses, that can have the most disparate etiologies. So free radicals are not always the issue and antioxidants are not always the solution. Also, free radicals are actively used by our bodies (e.g. during immune responses) so excess antioxidants is not necessarily good.\n\nThe scientific literature at this regard is simply huge and it would be difficult to have a complete bibliography here. Here's a sample of papers and reviews at this regard, if someone who is more in the field knows better papers/reviews please feel free to update my answer (sorry most of these are limited access papers).\n\nAir pollution: mechanisms of neuroinflammation and CNS disease. - Block and Caldero\u0301n-Garciduen\u0303as, Trends Neurosci., 2009\n\nOxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in cerebrovascular disease. - Chrissobolis et al, Front Biosci., 2011\n\nOxidative DNA damage in mild cognitive impairment and late-stage Alzheimer's disease. - Lovell and Markesbery, Nucleic Acids Res., 2007\n\nMitogenic signaling mediated by oxidants in Ras-transformed fibroblasts. - Irani et al, Science 1997  \n\nc-Myc can induce DNA damage, increase reactive oxygen species, and mitigate p53 function: a mechanism for oncogene-induced genetic instability. - Vafa et al, Mol Cell 2002\n\nand there is many many more.\n\nNot all antioxidants are good, however. For instance, this paper talks about the role of the transcription factor Nrf2, a factor which is involved in the physiological control of free radicals (so we can, by extension, call it an antioxidant inducing factor).

Diet soda is not always effective at preventing type 2 diabetes even though it is a zero-calorie drink.\n\n\n\nIn a Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis in 2009, diet soda consumption was positively associated with both metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n\n  In MESA, diet soda consumption was positively associated with both incident metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Associations between diet soda and risk of type 2 diabetes were of greater magnitude than the associations observed between diet soda and metabolic syndrome. Despite accumulating evidence of the existence of these associations, we are cautious not to conclude causality between diet soda and the diabetic or pre-diabetic condition. The possibility of confounding by other dietary and lifestyle/behavioral factors cannot be excluded from these observational studies. \n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8626#31036", "answerId": "31036"}
{"question": "Does addictive behavior exist?", "questionId": "981", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/981", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "These are soft sciences. You're not looking at a hard science; you can't do an fMRI and say \"look at how the addiction-response area lights up when this guy is playing MMORPGs.\"\n\nThe Wikipedia definition does a fine job of drawing the line, I'd like to point especially to:\n\n\n  . . . has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally or socially\n\n\nThis question doesn't spontaneously arise from the subset of alleged addictions that you point out. How do you know somebody doesn't just like cigarettes very much? You're always drawing a line based on some criteria.\n\nWe know that a person may become addicted to video games (for instance) because there have been people who let their lives be dominated by playing video games to the extent of their family leaving them, and them losing their jobs due to high absence.\n\nThe criteria for \"harming the individual\" is always sketchy. Certainly, it is conceivable that one could engage in a mild form of an activity that might be harmful. Drinking reasonable amounts of alcohol, or even a bit too much occasionally, might be somewhat harmful, but we'd probably argue that it isn't an addiction if the person doesn't have a problem keeping away from it for a considerable amount of time. I'd rather place emphasis on the \"or others\" part of the definition. If your partner suffers because of your habit, we may be inclined to call those habits addictive. On that note, see the website GamerWidow. Of course, even this criteria has to be coupled with a lot of others. You can't jump immediately from \"someone was harmed\" to \"therefore, I'm addicted to this causal activity.\"\n\nAgain, soft science. I don't think anybody can ever point to a single defining factor, or any definite threshold of anything, that either prove or disprove addiction. Think of it, rather, as a set of weighted inclusion and exclusion criteria that adds up, and that you draw a subjective line.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/981#984", "answerId": "984"}

He added, \u201cLet\u2019s face it: Chewing grinds up fiber to some extent, too.\u201d That said, \u201cwe have a fairly solid basis for saying: Whole food is best,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\nSo, while he believes the claim might be true, he admits the research isn't there yet.\n\nKatz goes on to point out that liquidizing food has other effects which may have an even more important role that the claim about fiber:\n\n\n  For one thing, \u201cblenderizing takes away chewing, which reduces the time spent eating\u201d and may inspire you to take in more. Also, \u201cfluids are less filling than solids.\u201d Finally, he added, turning foods into liquids markedly raises their glycemic load, which is a measure of how much a particular amount of food affects blood sugar and insulin levels. Indeed, a whole apple has a glycemic load of 6, while a serving of apple juice clocks in at 30\u2014higher even than Coca-Cola, at 16.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a 2017 article in the Atlantic take another tack, talking to  Robin Spiller, director of biomedical research at the Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre in the U.K.\n\nHe looked studied the consumption of soup, and found blending it stopped consumers from feeling hungry for longer! However, his explanation for this is that when foods in the stomach \"crack\" - split into layers, the water can be quickly absorbed by the body. If the water remains in emulsion, it takes longer to consume. \n\nOn the other hand:\n\n\n  Though it\u2019s not clear that all smoothies would do exactly the same thing as his chicken slurry soup, Spiller explains\n\n\nSo perhaps this argument isn't particularly strong for fruit smoothies, where the water may be easily absorbed.\n\nSpiller goes on to warn of other effects:\n\n\n  \u201cWhen you eat an apple, there\u2019s a lot of crunching,\u201d said Spiller. \u201cThat's a strong stimulus for the gut to secrete fluid. A lot of the behavior of your intestine is anticipatory \u2013\u2013 it has to work ahead of what's happening. It\u2019s no good producing enzymes to digest stuff when the material arrives. That\u2019s too late. You\u2019ve got to produce it ahead of time.\u201d\n\n\nSo there are other effects that affect hunger unrelated to the specific claim which is about fiber.\n\nStiller weighs in here too:\n\n\n  \u201cBlending won\u2019t have a significant negative impact on fiber,\u201d Spiller reassured me. \u201cFiber is what\u2019s responsible for the viscosity of a smoothie and its impact on the bacteria of the large bowel. Mashing fiber up into small pieces should only enhance its availability for the bacteria. Its prebiotic effect is definitely unimpaired\u2013\u2013it might be enhanced, even.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSo, the tally is:\n\n\none guy who is known for controversial claims says it has an effect, \none expert says he thinks it does (but has no research to support it) and points out other more significant effects.\none expert says he thinks it doesn't (but doesn't quote any research), and points out other more significant effects.\n\n\nWhat does the actual research say?\n\nI have to note that I was hampered by the number of papers that matched my search because as part of the method for measuring the fiber in food, many experimentalists blended it first. It seems that they are not concerned about the effect of blending.\n\nI found some research in hamsters showing that particle size affected digestion, but they were talking about \"micronization\", and I don't think blenders count.\n\nThe best reference I found was:\n\n\nEmma Derbyshire, Where are we with Smoothies? A Review of the Latest Guidelines, Nutritional Gaps and Evidence, 2017, DOI:10.4172/2155-9600.1000632\n\n\nThis review paper quoted a couple of experimental studies:\n\n\n  Two studies have shown that fibre material is retained in smoothies.\n  Scientists from the University of Leeds found that that cell wall structure\n  of smoothies remained intact after they had been manufactured\n  and exposed to simulated digestion for up to 16 h [14]. It was also observed that smoothie mixing led to a 68% reduction in viscosity, 30%\n  reduction in total dietary fibre and 10% increase in soluble dietary fibre\n  [14]. Equally, another trial found that fibre material is still present in\n  the smoothies after processing-16.9% and 17.5% fruit cellular material\n  by weight in the two smoothies tested [15]. These findings revealed that\n  the fibre content retained in the smoothies resembled that similar to\n  the process of chewing fruit, with this potentially having its own health\n  effects.\n\n\nSo, yes, the blender had an effect, but the author likened it to chewing.\n\n\n\nMy conclusion is that the research isn't there to support the claim that a blender affects the fibre more than chewing fruit might. However, there are a plethora of other reasons which may cause similar effects - to feel hungrier sooner or to consume more fruit faster.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/45472#45473", "answerId": "45473"}

{"question": "Can eating sugar result in addiction?", "questionId": "19060", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19060", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Sugar plays a role too, but the personality traits are more important.\n\n\n  Sugar can induce reward and craving that are comparable in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs. The neural substrates of sugar and sweet reward appear to be more robust than those of cocaine. Although this evidence is limited by the inherent difficulty of comparing different types of rewards and psychological experiences in humans, it is nevertheless supported by recent experimental research on sugar and sweet reward in laboratory rats [1].\n\n\nWhen it comes to humans, food habit and addictive personality matter:\n\n\n  In recent years, a compelling body of evidence suggests that foods high in sugar and fat have the potential to alter brain reward circuitry in a manner similar to that seen when addictive drugs like alcohol and heroin are consumed in excess. These findings have led to suggestions that some cases of compulsive overeating may be understood as an addiction to sweet, fatty, and salty foods. In this paper, it is proposed that high seasonality is a risk factor for binge eating, especially in those characterized by anxious and impulsive personality traits - associations that could only occur in an environment with a superfluity of, and easy access to, rich and tasty foods. ... Results confirmed that symptoms of binge eating and other addictive behaviors were significantly inter-correlated, and that seasonality, gender, and addictive personality traits were strong statistical predictors of the variance in binge-eating scores. Seasonality and addictive personality traits also accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in the measure of addictive behaviors. [2]\n\n\nIt seems that fats have an increased addictive potential when compared to sugar:\n\n\n  Food craving was linked positively to fat content, but negatively to sugar. Food liking was associated negatively with sugar content and processing level. Addictive-like eating predicted elevated overall food craving and liking, and increased craving and liking for processed foods. Attempted restriction efforts were unrelated to craving and liking. BMI was associated with less craving for fattier foods and lower liking for the average food. Hunger was associated with increased craving for the average food. These findings highlight the role of fat in cravings and differences in craving and liking based on BMI, loss of control over eating, and hunger [3].\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nAhmed SH, Guillem K, Vandaele Y.

{"question": "Is routine screening for breast cancer for asymptomatic women worthwhile?", "questionId": "6473", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6473", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "No, screening does not save lives even for the higher risk older groups never mind the lower risk 40-50s.\n\nThe evidence I'm going to quote below addresses the broader question of whether screening works for any age group (which was my original question). But, since the evidence clearly shows that the risk of having breast cancer grows with age (older women have higher risk) I hope that simple logic will show that this answer will be even more relevant to the younger group the question now addresses.\n\nI also need to make a statistical clarification before quoting what thorough reviews say, as careless language is one of the reason that the stats are often misunderstood. One key problem is the casual confusion of all-cause mortality with breast-cancer mortality. It is easy to assume that mammography (which is designed to screen for breast cancer) must reduce all cause mortality because it catches some cases of breast cancer. But many studies show a reduction in breast-cancer mortality but no reduction in overall mortality. Guess which number is used by advocates of screening?\n\nThe latest Cochrane review (published in 2011) is here. The review was designed to assess:\n\n\n  To assess the effect of screening for breast cancer with mammography on mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nHere is one part of the conclusion relevant to the statistical clarification i made above (I've highlighted the important bits and I quote at length to show the different results from different trials):\n\n\n  Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality with an RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.83). \n  We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. The trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on cancer mortality, including breast cancer, after 10 years (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10) or on all-cause mortality after 13 years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03).\n\n\nThe overall conclusion was (my emphasis again):\n\n\n  Screening is likely to reduce breast cancer mortality. As the effect was lowest in the adequately randomised trials, a reasonable estimate is a 15% reduction corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. Screening led to 30% overdiagnosis and overtreatment, or an absolute risk increase of 0.5%. This means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings. It is thus not clear whether screening does more good than harm. Note that more recent large scale studies are now questioning whether the apparent reduction in cancer mortality is real, weakening even further the argument that screening is useful (see latest update for references).\n\n\nThe review recognizes that it is not up to the medical community to recommend blanket screening as only the informed patient can weigh up the cost against the benefit. \n\nTwo key points are worth repeating. Screening isn't costless and the cost of false positives and unnecessary treatment are high. And there is no good evidence that overall mortality is reduced by screening. The intuition expressed by many (especially those lobbyists and politicians who backed away from the original recommendations of the Preventative Services Task Force) is not backed by the hard evidence.\n\nThis answers both my original question \"does screening reduce mortality\" and the more specific question now asked about screening in the low risk 40-50 year olds. \n\n\n\nSome additional information to clarify some misunderstandings raised in comments\n\n\n\nWhat is a Cochrane review?\n\nOne thread of comment on the original answer accused me of selectively quoting a result to bolster my preferred point of view. But what I had quoted was not a single result but a Cochrane Review. It appears that not everyone knows what that is and why it is the opposite of a single literature result.\n\nCochrane Reviews are systematic reviews of the complete literature of studies relevant to a particular claim. They review the known results for quality, bias and the strength of their results and produce a systematic analysis of the weight of evidence designed to summarise as best as possible the known literature. Wikipedia says:\n\n\n  The Collaboration [The Cochrane Collaboration is the independent organisation that conducts Cochrane reviews] aims to provide compiled scientific evidence to aid well informed health care decisions. It conducts Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of health care interventions and tries to disseminate the results and conclusions derived from them.\n\n\nThe reviews are described on the organisation's web site as (my emphasis):\n\n\n  Cochrane Reviews are systematic reviews of primary research in human health care and health policy, and are internationally recognised as the highest standard in evidence-based health care. They investigate the effects of interventions for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. They also assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test for a given condition in a specific patient group and setting. They are published online in The Cochrane Library.\n\n\nSo when I quote results from the Cochrane Library I am not being selective, I am trying to reference the best possible analysis of the whole literature. Moreover, the Cochrane reviews should be less subject to bias than the reviews by government bodies who face political pressure and embarrassment when they change their mind on anything.\n\n\n\nWhy is this a controversial issue?\n\nIt is easy to misunderstand the risk-reward pattern of medical screening. Popular understanding tends to assume (in the absence of epidemiological evidence) that screening is cost-free. It's not exactly surgery, is it? This view has been reinforced by the advice produced by governments to encourage patients to participate in screening programmes. This advice has often been criticised for not being honest about the harms of screening (the controversy in the NHS about patient advice is summarised in the BMJ here). The article argues that even the revised NHS leaflet fails in its duty because:\n\n\n  No mention is made of the major harm of screening\u2014that is, unnecessary treatment of harmless lesions that would not have been identified without screening. This harm is well known and acknowledged, even among screening enthusiasts. It is in violation of guidelines and laws for informed consent not to mention this common harm, especially when screening is aimed at healthy people.\n\n\nA previous analysis of advice to patients from other health systems argued:\n\n\n  The major harm of screening, which is overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment of healthy women, was not mentioned in any of 31 invitations.\n\n\nThe early days of screening also happened to coincide with significant improvement in breast cancer mortality which was ascribed to the benefits of screening. In principle, however, mortality can be improved by better treatments which would have been implemented even in the absence of screening. Recent evidence has tipped the balance away from screening (see this BMJ review comparing different European countries).\n\nSo there are several reasons why many people will overstate the net benefits of screening. as better evidence emerges it is likely that that evidence will provoke controversy. \n\n\n\nUpdate February 2014\n\nAnother large long term and properly randomised study (in the BMJ) has concluded that screening doesn't even reduce mortality from breast cancer (at least when good therapies are available). In their words:\n\n\n  Annual mammography in women aged 40-59 does not reduce mortality from breast cancer beyond that of physical examination or usual care when adjuvant therapy for breast cancer is freely available. Overall, 22% (106/484) of screen detected invasive breast cancers were over-diagnosed, representing one over-diagnosed breast cancer for every 424 women who received mammography screening in the trial.\n\n\nSo screening does no good but comes at the cost of significant over treatment (women suffer surgery and other clinical interventions that do harm but create no benefit).\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6473#6558", "answerId": "6558"}

The other putative risk factors, \"too much sex\" or STDs aren't backed by evidence (or even discussed) in the reviews of stress incontinence that I've looked at.\n\nIt's possible that some Twitter commenters have confused frequent urination (which is a symptom of gonorrhea) with incontinence (loss of control). Frequent urination is linked to urge incontinence in people with overactive bladder, but that's a different story.\n\n\n\nThe Wikipedia page about urinary incontinence (UI) you link to has a link to another about stress incontinence (SUI), which has this pathophysiology/definition:\n\n\n  the loss of small amounts of urine associated with coughing, laughing, sneezing, exercising or other movements that increase intra-abdominal pressure and thus increase pressure on the bladder.\n\n\nThat Wikipedia page doesn't say much about risk factors though, except for obesity... However there are several review papers in pubmed which discuss these.\n\nA 2004 review said in its abstract:\n\n\n  Aging, obesity, and smoking appear to have consistent causal relationships with the condition, whereas the roles of pregnancy and childbirth remain controversial. \n\n\nA 2011 review's abstract lists the following as common risk factors; i've added some snippets from the review itself where relevant:\n\n\nobesity, diabetes: \"Incidence of new-onset SUI was related to\nobesity in longitudinal cohort studies [...], supporting a\ncausal relationship.\" For diabetes, the association with SUI rather than with UI in general is less clear, studies had contradictory findings.\nage: \"The relative\ncontribution of each type of incontinence changes with age,\nwith SUI being predominant in young and middle-aged\nwomen. Urge (UUI) and mixed incontinence are predominant\nin older wom. [...] As women advanced in age, they were more likely to have\nSUI and UUI in combination.\"\npregnancy, delivery, and pelvic floor surgery: \"Several studies have reported a high prevalence\nof female SUI during pregnancy, ranging between 20% and\n60%; in particular, de novo occurrence is more frequent in\nnulliparous women. [...] Incontinence during pregnancy has been shown to be a\ngood predictor of postpartum persistent incontinence or of\nSUI recurrence 5 years after delivery [...]. Nevertheless, the\nmost important factor associated with the occurrence of SUI\nin young women is undoubtedly childbirth. In particular,\nsome risk factors associated with vaginal delivery have been\ndescribed as strongly related with the development of UI.\" (Emphasis mine)\ngenetic: huge variance in reported results for genetic factors of SUI from just 1.5% (2011 study) to 40% (2008 study).\nhormonal changes (unclear evidence)\n\n\nSo, Jameson's own explanation points to one of the more common risk factors (pregnancy)... even though not all reviews agree that the link is convincing.  The other Twitter explanations point out to even less discussed causes (STDs, \"too much sex\"), but that doesn't necessarily mean they are false. It's impossible to diagnose someone post-hoc and say \"this caused that in subject X\" unless you can remove \"this\" and obtain a cure/reduction for \"that\".\n\nNeither of the reviews I mentioned above discuss STDs (or too much sex, or even sex work) as a possible cause... which doesn't mean it can't be one, just that probably it isn't a common one nowadays in the general population. I tried to find some studies/data on SUI in sex workers, but insofar, no luck with that.\n\n\n\nThere isn't a whole lot of systematic epidemiological data about STDs in the US porn industry, but what is there is pretty daming. From a 2015 review:\n\n\n  A study conducted by the\n  renamed Los Angeles County Department of Public Health\n  (LACDPH) [ref9] found that between 2004 and 2007, there were\n  a total of 2,633 chlamydia and/or gonorrhea cases reported\n  among 1,849 adult film performers in Los Angeles County, of\n  which 72 percent of the cases were among females. This study\n  also found a 26 percent rate of reinfection within one year\n  among performers. In a 2012 UCLA study, nearly one-third\n  of performers tested positive for chlamydia and/or gonorrhea\n  despite the adult film industry\u2019s testing standards. [ref10]\n\n\nIn (my) comparison, looking at the 2016 CDC data for incidence among the general population, chlamydia and/or gonorrhea account for 497+146 = 643 cases per 100,000 people, so a prevalence of (new cases) of only 0.64% in the general population. So the incidence in the porn industry appears way over the average for the general population.\n\nAnd finally emedicinehealth.com notes that some STDs (AIDS, neurosyphilis, and genital herpes affecting the perineal area (perineal neurosyphilis)) as a cause for overflow incontinence (which \"occurs because the bladder is too full and urine passively leaks or overflows through the urinary sphincter\"), but it doesn't say anything about the link between stress incontince [which it does discuss] and STDs.\n\nSo, despite the fact that STDs seem much more prevalent among the US porn industry workers (than in the general population), it's still not clear that porn work is a risk factor for SUI... because while some forms of incontinence are caused by some STDs, I couldn't find a source discussing the association of STDs with SUI.\n\nMy guess is that the Twitter comments pointing to \"the clap\" did so because ghonorrea symptoms include frequent urination, but the latter is not the same thing as SUI.\n\n\n\nAs for the hypothesis that (too much) sex is causing SUI, coital incontinence (CI) probably deserves a mention in this context, although \"too much\" (sex) means something else here, namely that in women predisposed to penetrative CI, deep penetration may trigger it. Penetrative CI is associated with (other forms of) SUI more than the orgasmic CI variant is; the etiology and pathophysiology of orgasmic CI are more controversial. The (previously linked) review I in which I found this info, doesn't mention the frequency of sexual encounters as a factor for either form of CI (or for SUI). So it's probably fair to assume there's no known link.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40156#40164", "answerId": "40164"}

{"question": "Is the 'glycogen restoration window' real?", "questionId": "3794", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3794", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Short answer: Yes.\n\nLong answer: At least as far as glycogen is concerned, it probably doesn't matter for the vast majority of people who do moderate exercise once a day.  However, protein synthesis is also increased during the refueling window, and everybody can benefit from that.\n\nIt's well established that calories get turned into glycogen more quickly if consumed shortly after a workout.  The American College of Sports Medicine's 2009 Position on Nutrition and Athletic Performance has this to say (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  Timing of postexercise carbohydrate intake affects glycogen synthesis over the short term (110). Consumption of carbohydrates within 30 min after exercise (1.0-1.5 g carbohydrate\u00b7kg-1 at 2-h intervals up to 6 h is often recommended) results in higher glycogen levels after exercise than when ingestion is delayed for 2 h. It is unnecessary for athletes who rest one or more days between intense training sessions to practice nutrient timing about glycogen replenishment provided sufficient carbohydrates are consumed during the 24-h period after the exercise bout. Nevertheless, consuming a meal or snack near the end of exercise may be important for athletes to meet daily carbohydrate and energy goals.\n\n\nThe 1996 study they cite to back up that bolded section doesn't really make that claim, except for this bit in their discussion:\n\n\n  ...it is considered that the major benefit of consuming carbohydrate in the immediate recovery phase is to promote earlier recovery rather than exploit a period of increased glycogen storage rate. \n\n\nOK, fair enough.  Anyone working out one hour a day will be probably be burning 500-1000 calories.  The typical human has 1500-2000 calories worth of glycogen stores.  Unless you're starving yourself the rest of the day, those stores will be replenished by your next workout no matter how slowly you're synthesizing it.  The \"glycogen restoration window\" is only really significant for athletes who want to turn around and do another workout a few hours after the first one.  \n\nBut protein synthesis also slows way down after the refueling window.  This 2001 paper in AJP (titled \"Postexercise nutrient intake timing in humans is critical to recovery of leg glucose and protein homeostasis\", in the American journal of Physiology) has some nice charts of protein turnover in the leg when refueling early (right after exercise) or late (3 hours later).  This one shows that late refuelers actually have a net loss of protein in the short-term once you account for protein lost during exercise.\n\n\n\nClearly a net loss of protein is not optimal recovery.  I don't know where the \"60 minutes\" number came from (or 90 minutes or 30 minutes or whatever else the people on triathlon forums are throwing around these days).  But there is a definite benefit to recovery from having your meals sooner rather than later after your workout.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3794#6049", "answerId": "6049"}

Buyers of functional foods were regarded as more innovative and less gentle, but gender affected the ratings on gentle dimension. The impressions of functional food users clearly differ from those formed of users of conventional foods with a healthy image.\n\n\nA similar study by (Stein et al. 1995) used food lists rather than grocery lists. They had participants \"read a profile of either a female or male target including information about the target's preferred foods\". They found that \"[r]egardless of whether the target was male or female, targets described as preferring \u201cgood\u201d foods were rated as more feminine and less masculine than were targets described as preferring \u201cbad\u201d foods.\"\n\n(Barker et al. 1999) also used food lists rather than grocery lists. \"Subjects were\nthen asked to recall systematically and describe everything they consumed the day\nbefore, starting with when they got up.\" Subjects were then split into a high-fat or low-fat group. \"For the assessment of stereotypes, subjects were presented with lists of one\nhigh-fat diet (A) and one low-fat diet (B)\".\n\n\n  Subjects were then\n  given a list of adjectives and descriptors presented as sets of antonyms, and asked\n  to select appropriate adjective/descriptors from the list to describe consumers of\n  diets A and B.

That paper provides myriad references to other work showing consumption stereotypes along the line of \"you are what you eat\" and \"you are how much you eat\".\n\nThe meta-conclusion they made about stereotypes associated with \"what you eat\" is:\n\n\n  Overall, it appears that trait attributions emerge independent of target or rater sex, such that, for example, women and men are judged as being more feminine and less masculine when they eat low-fat foods than when they eat high-fat foods.

Atmospheric 14C can be reduced by the release of low 14C carbon, because this input dilutes the atmospheric signature. Because 14C has a half life of 5000 years, only 0.5^(age_x/5000) times the initial 14C will remain at age_x. \n\nCO2 that is depleted in 14C comes from:\n\n\nThe burning of fossil fuels is the most important source of 14C depleted CO2\nHistorically, increased soil temperatures and reduced glacial coverage have released depleted CO2 from soils\nThe circulation of the ocean brings 'old' CO2 from the deep ocean to the surface, where it exchanges with 'new' CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\n\nThere are two major sinks of CO2 from the atmosphere, these sinks remove 14C CO2 in proportion to its atmospheric concentration:\n\n\nphotosynthesis (plant and algae), some of which is buried or sink in the ocean\nbeing dissolved in the ocean\n\n\nFinally, the average time that a molecule of CO2 remains in the atmosphere is between 5 and 200 years (IPCC 2007 table 2.14), so after an anomalous change, the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere will return to equilibrium with sources and sinks over time. This can be seen in first figure below.\n\nIn the figures below, the y axis is &#916;14C. &#916;14C is the per-mil (parts per thousand) deviation in the 14C content of CO2 relative to the pre-weapons testing atmosphere (c. 1950).\n\nFurther introduction and technical references can be found at Dr. Fiona Petchy's website, references with a global change emphasis can be found at the Radiocarbon in Earth System Science Short Course website.\n\nAnswer\n\n[14Catm] has been declining since the bomb spike\n\n14C increased sharply (first figure) from the 1940s through the early 1960's due to the peak in nuclear tests. Since the atomic weapons ban treaty, atmospheric 14C levels have been steadily declining, but the rate of this decline has been slowing as atmospheric 14C reaches equilibrium with other sources and sinks. This is primarily the result of:\n\n\nthe uptake of CO2 by the biosphere (plants, plankton) \nexchange with older CO2 in the ocean and \nthe release of CO2 from fossil fuels into the atmosphere (radiocarbon depleted in fossil fuels).\n\n\n\n\nA classic paper on this is Nydal and Lo\u0308vseth (1983), who report records of 14C in the atmosphere - observed at a range of sites from 78N to 21S between 1960 to 1981. They demonstrate that the shape of the 14C 'bomb spike' is consistent across latitudes as well as the expected effects of atmospheric mixing between hemispheres and between the free atmosphere and the ocean surface.\n\nMeasurements at the ocean surface are relatively lower because this is where CO2 from the atmosphere is being exchanged with CO2 from the ocean, which much older and more depleted on average. \n\n[14C_atm] continues to decline\n\nPlenty of recent studies demonstrate that the decline continues to present. For example, Levin and Kromer (2004) provide a more recent analysis demonstrating that this trend continued into the 2000s:\n\n\n\nThe looooong (50ky) view\n\n14C has been declining over longer time scales as well, as explained by Hughen et al 2004, resulting from a combination of changes in the earth's magnetic field, the release of 14C depleted CO2 from the deep ocean, and the coupling of atmospheric 14C-CO2 uptake by plants and old C release from soils that occurred during glacial retreat from 12ky ago to present.\n\nFor consistency with the above figures (keeping time from left to right), the direction of the x-axis in the figure below (years before present) is reversed.

Doses of more than 50,000 IU per day raise levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to more than 150 ng per milliliter (374 nmol per liter) and are associated with hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.\n  \n  Doses of 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day for up to 5 months, however, do not cause toxicity. (Holick, 2007)\n\n\nHe concludes:\n\n\n  Much evidence suggests that the recommended adequate intakes are actually inadequate and need to be increased to at least 800 IU of vitamin D3 per day. Unless a person eats oily fish frequently, it is very difficult to obtain that much vitamin D3 on a daily basis from dietary sources. Excessive exposure to sunlight, especially sunlight that causes sunburn, will increase the risk of skin cancer. Thus, sensible sun exposure (or ultraviolet B irradiation) and the use of supplements are needed to fulfill the body's vitamin D requirement.

Recently, evidence has accumulated\n  indicating that stimulation of cannabinoid receptors by either THC or\n  the endocannabinoids influence the intracellular events controlling\n  the proliferation and apoptosis of numerous types of cancer cells,\n  thereby leading to anti-tumour effects both in vitro and in vivo. This\n  evidence is reviewed here and suggests that future anti-cancer therapy\n  might be developed from our knowledge of how the endocannabinoid\n  system controls the growth and metastasis of malignant cells.

(This is one of the characteristics that make uranium a viable choice for armor-piercing munitions.) It also means that what comes out the other side of the armor plate is no longer a solid penetrator, but a cloud of uranium, which will then ignite as uranium is pyrophoric.\n\nThis also means that what is being left on a battlefield is not the same thing as is lying around in a US arsenal (a metallic DU penetrator), but mostly triuranium  octaoxide (U3O8), plus uranium  dioxide (UO2) and uranium trioxide (UO3).\n\n-- Report of the World Health Organization Depleted Uranium Mission to Kosovo, page 6.\n\nWhich will then get into the dust you breathe, the water you drink, and the food you eat, much more readily than a couple pounds of solid DU...\n\n3) Uranium is toxic.\n\nUranium is a heavy metal, in itself already quite toxic. Many of its compounds are even more so. Think \"mercury\" and you are not far off the mark.\n\n4) Uranium is mostly an alpha emitter.\n\nThat's fine if you are handling uranium (that lump of metallic DU), because alpha particles don't even penetrate your outer skin, let alone gloves.\n\nBut if you get an alpha emitter inside your body (like inhaling dust, or eating contaminated food), that's actually worse than e.g. a gamma emitter, because alpha particles do much more damage to what they do hit. What might be negligible on your outer skin does become a problem in your lung tissue, or your kidneys, where radiation does not have to penetrate deep to cause damage.\n\nAnd since it's next to impossible to decontaminate the insides of your lungs, or your blood stream, those alpha emissions won't stop anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n  I'm looking for hard evidence from well thought out scientific studies - not hearsay, not anecdotal, not sensationalism.\n\n\nBritish Army doctors do think so, for one...\n\nThe big problem with all of the above, as with any chemical / radiological contamination, is to prove causality. People do get cancer. Children are born with birth defects. Sometimes numbers go up, sometimes they do get down. How can you prove that they went up for one specific reason, to the exclusion of anything else?\n\nYou don't do \"in vitro\" studies where you feed people uranium compounds, or let them breathe dust with uranium compounds in them, to compare their health compared to a control group...\n\nPlus, especially following a large-scale conflict, getting reliable data on e.g. cancer rates before a conflict vs. after a conflict can be hard. The WHO report I linked above, for example, came up \"inconclusive\" in no small part due to the difficulties in getting reliable statistical data.\n\nWe know that uranium compounds are unhealthy, both chemically and radiologically. Not just resulting in cancer, but other unfavorable conditions as well.\n\n\n  In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.\n\n\n-- Hindin, R.; et al. (2005). \"Teratogenicity of depleted uranium aerosols: A review from an epidemiological perspective\"\n\nSo, dodging the question as-asked because I know there are people out there just waiting to pounce on this because I cannot come up with a conclusive study for cancer in Serbia specifically... if in doubt, stay away from places where DU munitions hit hard objects.

(2015)\n  \n  U. dioica is considered a good remedy for rheumatism, asthma, anaemia and gout (Launert, 1981; Foster and Duke, 1990; Adams et al., 2009; Hayta et al. 2014; Zlatovic\u0301 et al., 2014). Moreover, nettles are used to treat burns, viral, bacterial and fungal diseases (Foster and Duke, 1990; Adams et al., 2009). Nettle is also a good pain reliever for rheumatism (Randall et al., 1999; Bown, 1995; Hajhashemi and Klooshani, 2012). New investigations showed that these recent results confirm the folkloric use of the plant extract to treat painful and inflammatory conditions. Further studies are needed to characterise the active constituents and the mechanism of action of the plant extract (Hajhashemi and Klooshani, 2012).\n\n\nIt should be noted that as phrased in the question: \"taking a bath in stinging nettles\" \u2013 it is probably a bit of a misconception. It is not really needed to use fresh, and still stinging, nettles. In saunas broom sticks are first dried and then dipped into hot water before using them, reducing the sting substantially. It seems to confer beneficial effects when used as a completely non-stinging extract in a bath as well.\n\nThe contents of the burn hairs might do something on their own and help the other juices enter the skin but most of the more interesting contents (like cytokine modulator hydroxyoactedecatrienic acid) are not primary constituents in in the burn hairs. It gets further complicated by newer findings calling into question the whole understanding of the mechanism of action as well as the constituents of the defensive trichomes of nettles.\n\n\n  Pharmacognostical review of Urtica dioica L. (2014) The plant methanolic extract at doses 200 and 400 mg/kg has been shown to inhibit dose dependently acetic acid\u2010induced abdominal twitches and carrageenan induced paw edema. The N\u2010Methyl\u2010D\u2010aspartate (NMDA) injection\u2010induced brain lesion and subsequent inflammation in wistar rats significantly decreasing the nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010kB) binding activity to DNA on administration of Urtica dioica leaf supplementation which suggests a signi cant anti\u2010inflammatory effect. [...]\n  The compounds quercetin\u20103\u2010O\u2010rutinoside, kaempherol\u20103\u2010O\u2010rutinoside and isorhamnetin\u20103\u2010O\u2010glucoside present in the methanolic extract of the aerial parts of the plant contribute to the immunomodulatory activity of the plant.\n\n\nTrying to explain another possible mechanism of action is:\n\n\n  Scientific Basis of Botanical Medicine as Alternative Remedies for Rheumatoid Arthritis (2013)\n  [...] and Urtica dioica. Scientific research has demonstrated that these herbs have strong anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects. A wide range of phytochemicals including phenolic acids, phenylpropanoid ester, triterpene glycosides, phthalide, flavonoids, triterpenoid saponin, diterpene and triterpene have been isolated and demonstrated to be responsible for the biological effects of the herbs. Understanding the mechanisms of action of the herbs may provide new treatment opportunities for RA patients.\n\n\nOne such RA medication recently approved is a pill, not a topical ointment, containing mostly lipophilic chemicals of the plant extract. Of thes ingredients 13-Hydroxyoactedecatrienic acid, which was proven to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, thereby directly interfering with the disease process, among other modes.\n\nWhile it seems quite true that: \n\n\n  The unsatisfactory outcome of current drugs for treating rheumatoid arthritis has led to the consideration of alternative medicine. Modern biological immunomodulators, while showing efficacy in the treatment of RA, may carry as yet unknown side effects. Botanical drugs from traditional Chinese medicine have been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis since ancient times. In recent years, advanced and sophisticated research has been done on many medicinal herbs and some have demonstrated possible efficacy. With the help of modern science and technology, the chemical constituents and underlying mechanisms are being developed.\n  \n  \n\n\nReviewing the application of herbal medicine and its effectiveness: \n\n\n  Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Herbs with Special Emphasis on Herbal Medicines for Countering Inflammatory Diseases and Disorders - A Review. (2018, in print)\n  Conclusion: Natural herbs are safe, effective and better options as anti-inflammatory agents than synthetic ones. The phytoconstituents are as effective with the comparable mechanism of action as synthetic molecules. \n\n\nThe chemical constituents are there to explain quite a bit of action, also applied topically. As the paragraph cited above indicates, until recently systematic research into this avenue was not really attractive for pharmaceutical companies developing drugs. Only the persistent failure of conventional new drug development to arrive at a satisfactory relationship between effects and side-effects has renewed scientific interest in the herbal medicine direction.\n\nThat means there is a comparative lack of research comparing thousands of years of folklore uses and believe in \"it works\" with decades of pharmacological research into synthetic drugs and their result of \"it works almost OK, but not great and has a number of side effects\". The current verdict on reviewing the evidence systematically still stands:\n\n\n  Topical herbal therapies for treating osteoarthritis(2013)\n  \n  We are also uncertain if other topical herbal products (Marhame-Mafasel compress, stinging nettle leaf) improve osteoarthritis symptoms due to the very low quality evidence from single trials. No serious side effects were reported. \n  Conclusions:\n  Although the mechanism of action of the topical medicinal plant products provides a rationale basis for their use in the treatment of osteoarthritis, the quality and quantity of current research studies of effectiveness are insufficient. [...] Further high quality, fully powered studies are required to confirm the trends of effectiveness identifed in studies so far.\n\n\nConclusion\nDepending on target and mode of application: even a bath in still stinging nettles might help with joint pains. That may be a bit of an unpleasant tradition that does probably represent the oldest and cheapest but not even the most effective route to deliver the drugs contained in nettle.

The most direct and shortest answer is: No, it does not depend on so much artificial fertilizer. \"A uses B\" is not the same as \"A depends on B\". The plants are not going to die if they have no synthetic fertilizer applied.\n\n1) Non-synthetic fertilizers could be used. There is nothing to cite here, as that would be proving a negative. Instead, if anyone were to believe non-synthetic fertilizers were necessary, the onus of burden would be on them to prove why.\n\n2) Another option is to use no fertilizers at all. There are options other than fertilizers that can be used. Letting a resource rest and replenish itself is one tactic. Rotation is another. Farmers can plant different crops in a field each year. The different plants have different needs, so by planting crop A this year they consume more of chemical B from the ground, but next year plant C needs chemical D, so we're all good - further, some plants actually put certain nutrients into the ground which could be good for next year's crop. You can also let a field lie fallow. You can also just completely ignore a field for 1 or more years so it has plenty of rest. All of these options can be done using zero fertilizer.\n\n3) You can also just ignore good farming practices and just do whatever you want, just keep planting the same thing in the same place and accept that your plants will eventually perform poorly.\n\nSo many non-synthetic fertilizer options.\n\nMany of these options will result in at least slightly reduced crop yield, so you need to utilize more land area to get the same amount of product output. But again, that does not mean that there is a dependency on the synthetic fertilizer, just that the synthetic fertilizer is chosen instead of using more land area.\n\nSo you see, there are other resources that can be used instead of synthetic resources, such as: non-synthetic fertilizers, land, different choices in field planning. Even if you do use these other options, however, once you have used all your non-synthetic fertilizer, all the land available, and if you are using proper field planning techniques, then that leaves you with X amount of produce. If you want greater than X, then you need to find some other way to increase production, and if you're already doing everything else then the answer is either use synthetic fertilizer or accept the amount of produce you have.\n\nSo no, there is no dependency. It is a choice, a choice which not everyone in the world makes. Synthetic fertilizer is just another tool in the toolbox, and each tool user decides what tools they use. Because it's easiest and provides the maximum produce per unit area, many decide to just order up a tank of fertilizer, whether it is synthetic or not, and drop it on the field.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44374#44409", "answerId": "44409"}

We investigate the temporal pattern of deaths around the time of changes in the estate tax system - periods when living longer, or dying sooner, could significantly affect estate tax liability.

This is called \"Linderman's law of trophic efficiency\" (Linderman. 1942), but it is far from a law - the reality is that there is a large variety of trophic efficiencies, and these depend on the type of animal and the food being consumed. Linderman's law is a heuristic tool - a concept useful for teaching not strictly based on fact. \n\na more detailed explaination:\n\nIn a simple system, trophic levels are, e.g. plants, herbivores, and carnivores. There are often more levels in the ocean than on land. For example, crustaceans eat algae, fish eat crustaceans, fish eat fish, sharks eat fish. Or cow eats grass, people eat cow.\n\nThe question is, of the available food at one level, how much is converted to growth (and can then become food) at the next level. This is the concept of 'trophic efficiency' accounts for both:\n\n\nthe efficiency at which available resource (food, light) is aquired\nthe efficiency with which the light / food is converted to growth\n\n\nThus, trophic efficiency =\n\n\n(consumed food / available food) x (food allocated to growth / total food consumed) =    \n(food allocated to growth / available food)\n\n\nIf a field produces 100 kg of grass each year, and a sheep living on that field gains 5 kg the sheep has a trophic efficiency of 5%. If a human ate 5kg of sheep, maybe they could gain 100 gm. If a human only ate the grass, they would loose weight and such a food web would not exist in nature.\n\nEven Linderman's original work reports a range of trophic efficienciens among the different trophic levels. In Table IV, efficiency. Note that productivity is the rate of growth (mass/time), not total biomass.\n\n\n\nA broad syntheses (Humphreys, 1979) demonstrates that indeed, trophic efficiency is related to the type of food eaten and the physiology of the animal consuming the food. \n\nFor example, non-social insects can have > 50% efficiency whereas most mammals, birds, and reptiles have &lt; 5% efficiency (Table 7, P/A% is the metric of interest, N is the sample size):\n\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6035#6038", "answerId": "6038"}

Why so why have my taste buds evolved to like something that is bad for me and dislike something that's good for me. It doesn't make sense.\n\n\nOur taste buds have evolved to identify high calorie items as tasty - sugar, fats, and protein. These types of food provide a much higher ratio of calories per gram. For much of our evolutionary history, given a choice between a fatty slab of meat and broccoli, those ancestors that chose the steak would have gained more calories and thereby increased their odds of not starving to death. Consequently, these genes got passed down the evolutionary tree.\n\nEating unhealthily is not the only example of things that feel good, but are bad for you. Take exercise. In our prehistoric past, a human who exerted less energy would have a greater chance at survival as he'd require less calories per day.

Here's a 60-second explanation of global warming.\n\nIt's conservation of energy. Fourier asked in 1824: the earth receives a continuous stream of energy from the sun. Why doesn't it keep getting hotter and hotter?\n\nThe answer is that the earth also radiates heat into space. A warmer object radiates more heat, so the earth warms up to a temperature where the incoming solar energy and the outgoing thermal energy balance each other (\"equilibrium temperature\").\n\nAs long as the incoming energy and outgoing energy balance each other, the total amount of energy in the system (land, oceans, atmosphere) remains the same, and the climate remains stable.\n\nHasn't climate changed in the past? Yes: if the brightness of the sun changes, or if there's variations in the earth's orbit, or if the reflectiveness of the earth changes, or if volcanic activity changes the composition of the atmosphere, these can all affect the energy balance, and therefore make the equilibrium temperature higher or lower.\n\nBut we can measure all these things, and right now only one of them is changing dramatically: atmospheric composition. By digging up and burning vast quantities of fossil fuels, releasing fossil CO2 into the atmosphere, we've been acting like a giant super-volcano.\n\nTyndall reported in 1861 that carbon dioxide blocks thermal radiation. The CO2 molecules absorb thermal radiation and re-radiate it in all directions, so some of it goes back downward towards the earth.\n\nYou can measure this in a lab, as Tyndall did, by shining infrared through a vessel of CO2. You can see it in the atmosphere: we have satellite measurements showing that outgoing thermal radiation has declined since 1970.\n\nSo incoming energy > outgoing energy. Additional heat accumulates until a new, higher equilibrium temperature is reached.\n\nIt takes a long time for the actual temperature to catch up with the equilibrium temperature. (Tyndall: the atmosphere acts like a dam thrown across a stream, the water rises behind the dam until it reaches the top.) So even if we could stabilize the current CO2 level today, the temperature will continue to rise.\n\nNovak's argument that CO2 molecules are too diluted to have a significant effect is incorrect. By reducing outgoing thermal radiation, the elevated CO2 level increases the equilibrium temperature at which incoming energy is balanced by outgoing thermal radiation. It has nothing to do with the temperature of the CO2 molecules themselves.\n\nBecause there's lots of random variation in temperature across the earth, what we see isn't a small uniform rise in temperature. Instead we see local or regional heat waves which are far hotter than in the past, like the 2003 heat wave in Europe which caused 70,000 premature deaths. For a more detailed view of the evidence of heat waves, see Hansen Sato Ruedy 2012.

In animals:\n\n\n  Dalm S, Karssen AM, Meijer OC, Belanoff JK, de Kloet ER: \"Resetting the Stress System with a Mifepristone Challenge\", Cell Mol Neurobiol. 2018 Sep 1. doi: 10.1007/s10571-018-0614-5.    \n  \n  Psychotic depression is characterized by elevated circulating cortisol, and high daily doses of the glucocorticoid/progesterone antagonist mifepristone for 1 week are required for significant improvement. Using a rodent model, we find that such high doses of mifepristone are needed because the antagonist is rapidly degraded and poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier, but seems to facilitate the entry of cortisol.\n   We also report that in male C57BL/6J mice, after a 7-day treatment with a high dose of mifepristone, basal blood corticosterone levels were similar to that of vehicle controls. This is surprising because after the first mifepristone challenge, corticosterone remained elevated for about 16 h, and then decreased towards vehicle control levels at 24 h. At that time, stress-induced corticosterone levels of the 1xMIF were sevenfold higher than the 7xMIF group, the latter response being twofold lower than controls. The 1xMIF mice showed behavioral hyperactivity during exploration of the circular hole board, while the 7xMIF mice rather engaged in serial search patterns. To explain this rapid reset of corticosterone secretion upon recurrent mifepristone administration, we suggest the following: (i) A rebound glucocorticoid feedback after cessation of mifepristone treatment. (ii) Glucocorticoid agonism in transrepression and recruitment of cell-specific coregulator cocktails. (iii) A more prominent role of brain MR function in control of stress circuit activity. An overview table of neuroendocrine MIF effects is provided. The data are of interest for understanding the mechanistic underpinning of stress system reset as treatment strategy for stress-related diseases.\n  \n  Roat-Shumway S, Wroolie TE, Watson K, Schatzberg AF, Rasgon NL: \"Cognitive effects of mifepristone in overweight, euthymic adults with depressive disorders\", J Affect Disord. 2018 Oct 15;239:242-246. doi: 10.1016/j.jad.2018.07.014.    \n  \n  Background: Previous studies have shown that individuals with mood disorders have a higher prevalence of both hypercortisolemia and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is posited to contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in individuals who have depression. However, the mechanistic relationship between cortisol and insulin within the central nervous system remains to be further elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the antiglucocorticoid agent, mifepristone, on metabolic function and cognitive performance in individuals receiving treatment for depressive disorders who were euthymic at baseline.\n  Methods:\n  Participants were administered a 600 mg/day dose of mifepristone for 28 days. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and cognitive assessments measuring verbal memory and executive functioning were administered at baseline and after 28 days of treatment.\n  Results:\n  Improvements in attention and verbal learning were associated with reduction of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in response to mifepristone treatment.\n  Limitations:\n  Limitations include the open-label design of this study and a small sample size.\n  Conclusions:\n  The findings from this study suggest that improvement in fasting plasma glucose levels, upon administration of mifepristone, is associated with the improvement in early input of verbal information.

Despite its prevalence and debilitating effects, treatments for anhedonia are lacking, primarily because its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dopamine (DA) has been implicated in anhedonia through its role in reward-related learning; glucocorticoid systems may also be involved in that anhedonia is often preceded by chronic stress.\n  Objective:\n  This study investigated DA and glucocorticoid systems in anhedonia using a rat version of the probabilistic reward task (PRT).\n  Methods:\n  Adult male Wistar rats were trained on the PRT and then tested following: (1) activation or inhibition of DA activity induced by amphetamine (AMPH) or pramipexole (PRAMI) injections, (2) chronic mild stress (CMS), or (3) glucocorticoid system activation (dexamethasone (DEX)) or inhibition (mifepristone (MIFE)).\n  Results:\n  AMPH increased and PRAMI decreased response bias, pointing to enhanced and diminished reward responsiveness with DA agonism and antagonism, respectively. CMS reduced response bias but only in a subpopulation of rats. DEX also decreased response bias, suggesting that glucocorticoid processes contribute to anhedonia, although glucocorticoid inhibition (MIFE) had no effect. None of the manipulations altered the ability to detect and respond to reward-paired stimuli.\n  Conclusions:\n  These results confirm a role of DA in anhedonia and elucidate the contribution of the glucocorticoid system to this effect. In addition, chronic stress may interfere with normal DA functioning, leading to impaired reward-related learning in some animals. These findings may direct future treatment of anhedonia by targeting DA and glucocorticoid systems, as well as a possible interaction between the two.\n  \n  Zhang YP, Wang HY, Zhang C, Liu BP, Peng ZL, Li YY, Liu FM, Song C: \"Mifepristone attenuates depression-like changes induced by chronic central administration of interleukin-1\u03b2 in rats\", Behav Brain Res. 2018 Jul 16;347:436-445. doi: 10.1016/j.bbr.2018.03.033. \n  \n  Increased proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, may play an important role in the etiology of depression because they cause the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to release glucocorticoids (GC) and induce dysfunction of serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission. Sustained increase in GC may activate microglia to induce neuroinflammation, and suppress astrocytes to produce neurotrophins, which lead to neuronal apoptosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist mifepristone (RU486) may attenuate IL-1\u03b2-induced depression-like behavior by regulating the neuroinflammation and neurotrophin functions of microglia and astrocytes. Rats received intracerebroventricular injections of IL-1\u03b2 (10 ng) and/or subcutaneous injections of RU486 for 14 days. Then animal depression-like behaviors, serum corticosterone concentration, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), mRNA and protein expressions of CD11b, GFAP and neurotrophins (pro-BDNF, BDNF, GDNF and their receptors TrkB, p75, GFR\u03b1-1 and GFR\u03b1-2) in the amygdala were studied. Compared to controls, significantly decreased rearing score and increased defecation in the open field test, decreases in ratio of open/closed time in the elevated plus maze and in sucrose preference, while increased level of corticosterone in the serum were found in the rats administrated with IL-1\u03b2. IL-1\u03b2 administration also reduced the expressions of GFAP, BDNF, GDNF and its receptor GFR-\u03b11, but increased the expressions of CD11b, pro-BDNF, p75 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) concentrations. RU486 treatment markedly attenuated these changes induced by IL-1\u03b2, except for the expressions of GFR-\u03b11. In conclusion, RU486 may improve depression-like changes by suppressing microglia and inflammation and promoting astrocytes to restore neurotrophin function.\n\n\nBut in humans as well:\n\n\n  Block TS, Kushner H, Kalin N, Nelson C, Belanoff J, Schatzberg A: \"Combined Analysis of Mifepristone for Psychotic Depression: Plasma Levels Associated With Clinical Response\", Biol Psychiatry. 2018 Jul 1;84(1):46-54. doi: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.01.008. \n  \n  Background:\n  Patients with psychotic depression exhibit elevated cortisol levels. Competitively antagonizing cortisol at the glucocorticoid receptor with mifepristone demonstrated therapeutic benefit in early studies of patients with psychotic depression. We present a combined analysis of all controlled phase 2 and 3 studies to report antipsychotic differences between treatment with mifepristone or placebo and to evaluate the relative contributions to response of attaining an a priori-defined, high mifepristone plasma level and markers of glucocorticoid receptor antagonism (increases in adrenocorticotropin hormone and cortisol) with treatment.\n  Methods:\n  Data from five similarly designed double-blind phase 2 or 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of 7-day treatment with mifepristone for the psychotic symptoms of psychotic depression were pooled for analysis (mifepristone n = 833; placebo n = 627). Clinical assessments were performed at baseline and on days 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56. Mifepristone, adrenocorticotropin hormone, and cortisol samples were collected at baseline and day 7.\n  Results:\n  Combined results demonstrated meaningful efficacy (p &lt; .004) for mifepristone in reducing psychotic symptoms with wide safety margins. Patients in the a priori-defined, high mifepristone plasma level group (\u22651637 ng/mL) demonstrated a more significant treatment effect over placebo (p = .0004). A number needed to treat of 7 and 48 was observed in the high and low mifepristone plasma level groups, respectively. Adverse events were similar in mifepristone- and placebo-treated patients.\n  Conclusions:\n  A high mifepristone plasma level carried the strongest association with response, followed by changes in adrenocorticotropin hormone and cortisol. Therapeutic plasma levels of mifepristone were most likely to be achieved with the 1200 mg/day dose.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/42420#42424", "answerId": "42424"}

The suggestion worked and the consumption of carrots increased sharply because people thought carrots might help them see better in the blackout, thus taking pressure off the food supplies.\n\n\nThus, the myth was introduced not to trick the Germans into believing the British didn't have airborne radar, but to encourage consumption of carrots when they were in excess and the British didn't have many food sources.\n\nThe Germans introduced countermeasures to airborne radar by 1942 (see here).

{"question": "Is leaving your AC fan (blower) on 24/7 during summer more efficient than leaving it on auto?", "questionId": "4912", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4912", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "The answer seems to be \"it depends\".  Given the commerciality and competitive nature of the HVAC industry, I had a lot of trouble finding peer reviewed academic studies that test your claims.  Therefore, I took a look at the patent records for evidence, which led me to US Patent #5492273.  This patent, owned by General Electric, describes a variable-speed blower that can be controlled independently of the compressor.  Here are some claims made in the background section of the patent:\n\n\n  In general, total heating of air conditioning capacity of a system increases as the indoor air flow rate increases.  However, upon reaching a particular air flow rate, the blown air will be less warm or less cool, depending on the mode of the HVAC system, than the air in the room.  For air conditioning systems, the indoor coil, or evaporator, tends to \"saturate\".  In other words, the the coil extracts incrementally less energy from the air for equal incremental changes in air flow.  Further, the electric power consumed by the indoor blower motor increases rapidly as the air flow rate increases.  The system dissipates electric energy as heat in the same air that is being cooled by the system thereby reducing its net cooling capacity.  Due to the effects of coil saturation and blower motor power consumption, net total capacity peaks at a certain airflow rate.\n\n\nLet me briefly summarize the salient points of that paragraph before continuing:\n\n\nFor traditional, single-blower-speed air conditioning systems, the efficiency of the system does not scale linearly with air flow speed.\nThe blower motor's electrical usage scales superlinearly with respect to air speed.\nThe faster the air speed the more the coil heats up, thus reducing its cooling efficiency the next time the condenser turns on:\n\n\n\n  an increase in the air flow rate beyond what is required warms the evaporator coil to produce a higher load on the compressor motor.\n\n\nThe patent goes on to explain that the reason why most traditional, single-speed blowers don't keep the blower on after the condenser has turned off is exactly because of point #3: The airflow will heat up the coil and require the condenser to remain on longer during the next cycle.  The patent also claims that some traditional systems try and avoid this by only switching off the compressor when in blower-only mode (i.e.,  also keeping pumping the refrigerant), however, the patent says that that uses almost as much electricity as running the entire system:\n\n\n  Conventional systems ... [delay] turning off the indoor blower fan after after the compressor cycles off. However, the system also continues to draw power at the same level as during the cycle and causes additional energy to be consumed in the indoor fan motor.[Emphasis is mine.]\n\n\nThis claim is a bit surprising.  The patent could of course be embellishing that claim in order to make its technology seem more useful.\n\nThe patent describes a variable speed blower motor that can work independently of the condenser to set the air flow to the optimal speed for cooling.  The thermostat, with information from both indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity sensors, can then intelligently decide how to control both the blower and the condenser.\n\nTherefore, I'd say that if you have one of these variable-speed blowers and intelligent thermostats (they're getting more common now; I have one in a house I recently bought), I'd say that it would be a bad idea to force the blower to stay on all the time because the system is smarter than you!  If, however, you have an older, single-speed system, that question is a lot more complicated, and it might actually be detrimental to run the blower all of the time.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4912#5333", "answerId": "5333"}

{"question": "Are refined edible oils unhealthy compared to unrefined ones?", "questionId": "14760", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/14760", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "A few things first to clear the air. (1) \"Refined\" can mean many things from simple filtration of foreign particles to a complicated process involving many steps, techniques, and chemicals. (2) The blog you link is not a reputable source, and neither are most \"health food\" sites that pop up when doing a search on this subject. As good skeptics, we want some measure of science, and even then we need to examine the evidence.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's just understand the basic bargain. Unrefined oil contains \"impurities\" some of them good for you, like nutrients or plant proteins, and some bad, like plant carcinogens or rat feces. Good and bad, these \"adulterants\" may taste bad, burn, or spoil easily. In general, unrefined oil will burn at a lower temperature and spoil faster than refined. Conversely, refined oil can withstand higher heat and will keep longer. That is the big picture here.\n\nNow, to your questions.\n\n\nDo oils become less nutritional after refining? A definite yes. The refining process removes iron, calcium, and magnesium among other things. Less harmful? That is a much more difficult question. This study, for example, finds that \"epidemiologic investigations of lung cancer among Chinese women have implicated exposure to indoor air pollution from wok cooking, where the volatile emissions from unrefined cooking oils are mutagenic.\" In other words, if you are going to burn things over a fire, you better burn the pure stuff.\nWhy are refined oils popular in India, and elsewhere? In the words of Roy A. Carr in the Journal of the American Oil Chemists\u2019 Society: \n\n\n  Crude vegetable oil contain variable amounts of non-glyceride impurities, such as free fatty acids, non fatty materials generally classified as \"gums\" or phosphatides, color pigments, moisture, and dirt. Most of these materials are detrimental to the finished product color, flavor, and smoking ability, and must be removed by purification step. \n\nAre unrefined oils harmful in other ways? The answer is again, unclear. Unrefined oils by definition contain stuff that is unaccounted for, some bad and some good. Refining produces a uniform product with known and controlled contaminants (hence journals with appetizing titles like Oil and Soap).\n\n\nPlease note that this answer does not constitute medical advice. It is only meant to summarize published research related to the original claim and limited to the cited sources.

{"question": "Do high-fat diets causes heart disease?", "questionId": "32423", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/32423", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "All fats do not have the same effect on the body when ingested even though they possess a similar chemical structure.\n\n\n  All fats have a similar chemical structure: a chain of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms. What makes one fat different from another is the length and shape of the carbon chain and the number of hydrogen atoms connected to the carbon atoms. Seemingly slight differences in structure translate into crucial differences in form and function. Source: The truth about fats\n\n\nFat from food provides energy, needed for building cell and nerve structures and also helps in absorption of some vitamins and minerals. It is essential for clotting of blood, movement of muscle, and inflammation. \n\n\n  The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that between 25 and 35 percent of your total calories come from fat, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a range of 20 to 35 percent. Source: All Fats Are Not Created Equal\n\n\nEvidence on the relation between fat and heart disease:\n\n\nLow-fat diets tend to have no effect on cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n\n  Based on this evidence, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee concluded that low-fat diets have no effect on CVD and emphasized the importance of healthful, food-based diet patterns.\n  \n  Based on this evidence, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee stated, for the first time, that dietary guidelines should not focus on lowering total fat. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\n\nRestriction on total fat indirectly leads people to consume large amounts of refined carbohydrates containing starch and added sugar.\n\n\n\n  The current restriction on total fat shapes numerous government feeding programs and policies; drives industry marketing of fat-reduced desserts, snacks, salad dressings, processed meats, and low-fat other products of poor nutritional value; and leads most Americans to actively avoid dietary fat and instead consume far too many refined carbohydrates. Avoidance of total fat also undermines attempts to limit refined starch and added sugar, while discouraging the food industry from providing products higher in healthful fats. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\n\nEvidence for monounsaturated fat (oleic acid) to be considered as a cardioprotective fat is mixed and focusing on specific types of foods and oils is advised as better against selecting foods only based on their monounsaturated fat content.\n\n\n\n  The current evidence for cardiometabolic benefits of total monounsaturated fat (largely oleic acid) is not strong. These results suggest that other compounds in these fats/oils may modify the overall health effects. Thus, focusing on specific types of foods and oils, rather than monounsaturated fat content per se, may be most prudent. Extra virgin olive oil and mixed nuts, and perhaps high-oleic canola oil, appear to be good dietary choices to improve cardiometabolic health. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\nResearch also shows that there is no other benefit of replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid apart from lowering serum cholesterol and this lowering does not relate to a lower risk of death from coronary heart disease.\n\n\n  Available evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that replacement of saturated fat in the diet with linoleic acid effectively lowers serum cholesterol but does not support the hypothesis that this translates to a lower risk of death from coronary heart disease or all causes. Findings from the Minnesota Coronary Experiment add to growing evidence that incomplete publication has contributed to overestimation of the benefits of replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid. Source: Re-evaluation of the traditional diet-heart hypothesis\n\n\n\nCardiometabolic effects of polyunsaturated fats such as seafood-derived n-3 fats is well documented.\n\n\n\n  The cumulative evidence from observational studies, clinical trials, and controlled interventional studies continues to favor plausible cardiovascular benefits of modest dietary fish consumption, in particular for the endpoint of CHD death. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\nConsumption of polyunsaturated fat-rich vegetable oils is advised for lowering risk of coronary heart disease.\n\n\n  Increased consumption of polyunsaturated fat-rich vegetable oils is an evidence-based strategy to lower CHD risk, whether in place of saturated fat or carbohydrate. Optimally, polyunsaturated fat-rich vegetable oils should perhaps replace refined starches and added sugars, given the independent harms of these refined carbohydrates. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\n\nHigher trans fatty acids (TFAs) intake from partially hydrogenated oils is known to be associated with the risk of coronary heart disease and sudden death.\n\n\n\n  In sum, the implicated pathways suggest that TFA-containing partially hydrogenated oils influence pathways related to adipocyte dysfunction and insulin resistance. Emerging evidence suggests that 18:2 TFA isomers may be the most adverse; these can be formed through not only partial hydrogenation, but also other industrial processes such as oil deodorization and high-temperature cooking.380,381 Because partially hydrogenated oils are food additives with clear adverse effects, their elimination is a public health priority. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\nEvidence on the relation between sugar and heart disease:\n\n\nRefined grains/grain products, sugar sweetened beverages, sweets and starch (certain potatoes) all produce brisk rises in blood glucose and insulin and may induce multiple adverse effects including cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n\n  In addition to direct harms, low-quality carbohydrates such as refined grains, certain potatoes, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and sweets may increase cardiometabolic risk by displacing other, healthier foods in the diet, eg, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and minimally processed whole grains. Consistent with this constellation of adverse effects, poor-quality carbohydrates are associated with long-term weight gain, diabetes mellitus, and CVD. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\n\nThe 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee advised that the \u201cconsumption of \u2018low-fat\u2019 or \u2018nonfat\u2019 products with high amounts of refined grains and added sugars should be discouraged\".\n\n\n\n  Based on their adverse effects and pervasiveness in modern diets, reducing refined grains, starches, and added sugars is a major dietary priority for cardiometabolic health. Although SSB intake is declining in the United States, intakes of added sugars in other foods and, even more so, of refined grains continue to represent a major part of the diet. Currently, nearly 3 in 4 Americans consume too many refined grain products. Indeed, many people seek out these products, erroneously believing they are beneficial based on their promotion as low-fat or fat-free foods. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\nSummary:\n\n\nTL;DR: Not all fats are created equal and the level of intake is the key to reducing adverse outcomes such as cardiovascular disease. Research into fat diets still advise that intake of saturated fats and unsaturated fats should be moderate in order to benefit the heart and to completely avoid or reduce foods high in transfat.\n\n\n\n  Polyunsaturated fats were shown to be fairly neutral in terms of heart health in recent research. These fats, which are in foods such as salmon and canola oil, were neither good nor bad, but \u201ctrending toward favorable,\u201d Dr. Nissen says. Oils rich in polyunsaturated fats also provide essential fats that your body needs but can\u2019t produce itself \u2014 such as omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.\n  \n  Monounsaturated fats provide the most health benefit, according to research, and are an important component of the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet, Dr. Nissen says. They are found in foods such as olive oil and sesame oil and in nuts such as almonds or walnuts. Source: You Can Eat Fat If You Choose Wisely\n\n\nRecent research evidence suggests some benefits of including saturated fat such as dairy fat or high-fat dairy foods such as cheese in diet. However, these recommendations are based more on the influences of fermentation/probiotics, calcium and vitamin D contents rather than their complete cardiometabolic effects. The American Heart Association (AHA) advises to keep the intake of saturated fats less than 7 percent of total daily calories. \n\n\n  The current science supports consuming more yogurt and possibly cheese; with the choice between low-fat versus whole-fat being personal preference, pending further investigation. This new evidence also calls for substantial further investment in research on cardiometabolic effects of dairy foods, including relevant components and molecular mechanisms. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\nA beneficial diet should have restriction in foods high in trans fat.\n\n\n  A maximally beneficial diet pattern should concurrently emphasize reductions in refined (not all) carbohydrates, processed meats, and foods high in sodium and trans fat; moderation in unprocessed red meats, poultry, eggs, and milk; and high intakes of fruits, nuts, fish, vegetables (excluding russet/white potatoes), vegetable oils, minimally processed whole grains, legumes, and yogurt. Source: Dietary and Policy Priorities for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity\n\n\n\nMore research is needed for authoritatively determining the connection between high dietary fat and its effect on heart diseases.\n\n\n\n  Although multiple factors have contributed to this decline, none of the other factors can explain this huge improvement in health, and the replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat (both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids) is almost certainly a major, probably most important, factor. Reversing these changes would almost certainly result in great harm.

{"question": "Can artificial sweeteners make you gain weight?", "questionId": "13993", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/13993", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "I suspect that no definitive answer is known, but below is some interesting research.  In general, it sounds like little research has been done to directly test the question humans.  Epidemiological evidence suggest otherwise, though that may be not be causation (ie overweight people trying to stem weight gain might tend to eat artificial sweeteners more).  If the food reward hypothesis of obesity is correct, that would also suggest that artificial sweeteners wouldn't necessarily aid in weight loss if they increase the palatability of caloric food.\n\nA recent small study in rats suggested artificial sweeteners can increase obesity, though nutritionist Marion Nestle is not particularly convinced.  \n\nThe most informative reference I can find (other than the paper mentioned by @Oliver_C in the comments) is this paper Gain weight by \u201cgoing diet?\u201d Artificial sweeteners and the neurobiology of sugar cravings.  From the weight loss section of the paper:\n\n\n  do artificial sweeteners actually help reduce weight?\n  \n  Surprisingly, epidemiologic data suggest the contrary. Several large scale prospective cohort studies found positive correlation between artificial sweetener use and weight gain. The San Antonio Heart Study examined 3,682 adults over a seven- to eight-year period in the 1980s. When matched for initial body mass index (BMI), gender, ethnicity, and diet, drinkers of artificially sweetened beverages consistently had higher BMIs at the follow-up, with dose dependence on the amount of consumption. Average BMI gain was +1.01 kg/m2 for control and 1.78 kg/m2 for people in the third quartile for artificially sweetened beverage consumption. The American Cancer Society study conducted in early 1980s included 78,694 women who were highly homogenous with regard to age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and lack of preexisting conditions. At one-year follow-up, 2.7 percent to 7.1 percent more regular artificial sweetener users gained weight compared to non-users matched by initial weight. The difference in the amount gained between the two groups was less than two pounds, albeit statistically significant. Saccharin use was also associated with eight-year weight gain in 31,940 women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study conducted in the 1970s.\n  \n  Similar observations have been reported in children. [...] In addition, consensus from interventional studies suggests that artificial sweeteners do not help reduce weight when used alone. BMI did not decrease after 25 weeks of substituting diet beverages for sugar-sweetened beverages in 103 adolescents in a randomized controlled trial, except among the heaviest participants. A double blind study subjected 55 overweight youth to 13 weeks of a 1,000 Kcal diet accompanied by daily capsules of aspartame or lactose placebo. Both groups lost weight, and the difference was not significant. Weight loss was attributed to caloric restriction. Similar results were reported for a 12-week, 1,500 Kcal program using either regular or diet soda. Interestingly, when sugar was covertly switched to aspartame in a metabolic ward, a 25 percent immediate reduction in energy intake was achieved. Conversely, knowingly ingesting aspartame was associated with increased overall energy intake, suggesting overcompensation for the expected caloric reduction. Vigilant monitoring, caloric restriction, and exercise were likely involved in the weight loss seen in multidisciplinary programs that included artificial sweeteners.\n\n\nEdit: July 7, 2013:  This opinion/summary piece from in Cell gives a good summary.  Based on the research discussed in the paper, the answer to your original question is: the best available evidence points to yes, artificial sweeteners can make you gain weight.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/13993#13999", "answerId": "13999"}
{"question": "Are food deserts a real phenomenon?", "questionId": "4927", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4927", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Nearly 13% of all households in Washington D.C. were struggling with hunger in 2007\u20132009.  The district is divided into wards, much like townships.  According to D.C. Hunger Solutions,\n\n\n  Wards 7 and 8, which have the District's highest poverty rates, also have the city's highest obesity rates and are home to large \"food deserts.\"\n  Of the city's 43 full-service grocery stores*, only two are located in Ward 4, four in Ward 7, and three in Ward 8. By contrast, Ward 3 - the highest-income Ward - has eleven full-service stores.\n\n\n* see the second comment, below, for my interpretation of \"full-service grocery store\".\n\nWard 8's poverty rate in 2009 was 35%.  I couldn't find an exact statistic for the area of Ward 8, but it appears to be at least 1/8th the area of the entire district, which is 100 square miles (260km2).  Assuming each of the ward's three grocery stores services an equal 100/8/3 \u2248 4 square mile area, I think it is plausible that a good number of the ward's residents live at least one mile from a supermarket.\n\nEdit: The original question is just asking if food deserts exist.  The problem is that the definition of a \"food desert\",\n\n\n  a low income area where people there cannot access high quality or nutritional food\n\n\nis a bit subjective: One can always have access to high quality or nutritional food if one is willing to spend enough time to travel to it.  If a person lives a couple miles away from a grocery store but has \"access\" via expensive (to them) public transport, does that constitute \"access\"?  Technically, of course, yes.  But what I think AgentKC is really asking\u2014and the question I have been trying to answer\u2014is: \"Is there any statistical correlation between proximity to full-service grocery stores, obesity, and poverty?\"  I think the answer to that is \"yes\".  Answering why is a much more difficult (and perhaps open) question.\n\nHere are some more points that came up in the discussion:\n\n\nAs John Rhoads pointed out, a mile walk to a grocery store isn't really very far. The problem is that, at least in urban environments, there are usually much more convenient and much less healthy options that are closer. Why would I walk 2+ miles to buy some veggies, fruit, and raw ingredients if I could walk to the end of my block and get an already prepared fast food hamburger or fried chicken for likely the same price?  (When I lived in a not-so-savory part of Philadelphia, I could buy a whole fried chicken at the end of my block for the same price as a raw chicken from the 1-mile-away grocery store). And if one is already obese, that walk to the store is even harder.\nAs DVK pointed out, many of these urban centers have extensive public transport systems that would allow carless residents to commute back-and-forth to a supermarket.  Here are some counter-arguments:\n\n\nFor people that live below the poverty line (the average per capita income in Camden, NJ, for example, is less than $12k), a public transit ride for as little as $3 is a significant expense.  And as Erik Harris noted, it is likely more expensive in DC.\nHow many shopping bags can one person reasonably carry home without a car?  Enough for a week's worth of food for a family of four?  I know that at least extrapolating from the way I shop, I'd have to make multiple trips per week to feed a family of 4, which is a further expense.\nAs DVK rightly noted, many of these factors are likely social/cultural in nature, however, that only speaks to the underlying cause; it does not change the fact that there is a correlation between availability of produce, obesity, and poverty.\n\nTownsend, et al., did a study on the correlation between food insecurity and obesity.  Here is a summary from Oregon State University:\n\n\n  [Obesity] may also result from periodic episodes of food insecurity.  For many people, food stamps and money for food run out before the end of the month.  Among respondents to the 2004 Oregon Hunger Factors Assessment, 95 percent ran out of food stamps at least 1 week before the end of the month.  When money and food stamps become available again, some may overeat low-cost, high-calorie foods that have limited nutrient density.  This could result in gradual weight gain over time, especially for mothers with dependents in the household.\n\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4927#4931", "answerId": "4931"}

He assumes that \"climate change will cost us roughly 1.5% of global GDP if we simply adapt to it as required\". For this figure, Topher cites (Stern, 2006, p. vi).\n\nHowever, the report actually says on p. vi:\n\n\n  the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least \n  5% of global GDP each year, now and forever. If a wider range of risks and impacts \n  is taken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20% of GDP or more.\n\n\nThat report also says on the same page:\n\n\n  In contrast, the costs of action \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the \n  worst impacts of climate change \u2013 can be limited to around 1% of global GDP each \n  year.\n\n\nThe report that he uses to establish the 1.5% of GDP actually says 5-20% of GDP. It also argues that the cost of avoiding the worst impacts can be limited to under 1% of global GDP.\n\nTopher picks the 1.5% figure from page ix, where the Stern report says (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  Most formal modelling in the past has used as a starting point a scenario of 2-3\u00b0C warming. In this temperature range, the cost of climate change could be equivalent to a permanent loss of around 0-3% [...]\n  \n  However, those earlier models were too optimistic about warming.

The chicken taste is actually more of a joke (EVERYTHING tastes like chicken).\n\nI did find this first hand account:  William Buehler Seabrook, a journalist with the New York Times, traveled to West Africa and lived with the Guere tribe. He asked the chief what human meat tasted like, but the chief couldn't describe it to Seabrook's satisfaction. Seabrook had the opportunity to try it himself, from a man who had recently died in an accident. He got a portion of stew with rice as well as a \"sizeable rump steak, also a small loin roast to cook or have cooked\" however he wanted. In his book \"Jungle Ways,\" he described it as follows:\n\n\n  \"It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable.\"\n\n\nThe Polynesians and Melanesians in the South Pacific called Europeans 'Long Pig' because they claimed their flesh tasted sweet like pork and much different compared to their neighbors. American firefighters often cannot stand the smell of bacon because it reminds them of burnt human flesh.\n\nSo we have two opinions: veal and pork.\n\nAs with any meat sold in the market, the taste will vary depending on what the person was raised on. A high-pork diet such as Europeans have, will result in a \"pork\" flavor. A high beef diet will result in a taste of veal (such as the quote above). An all-fish or vegan diet will probably produce a completely different taste. \n\nAs for heath effects, many are concerned about possible prion diseases associated with eating human flesh.\n\n\n  Prion diseases, a group of uncommon and deadly brain diseases, can be spread by eating the contaminated flesh of humans or other animals. The human brain is more contaminated with prions than other body parts, though bone marrow, the spinal cord and the small intestine also contain these fatal brain-eating malformations. Prion diseases occur when the prion protein misfolds, causing a cascade of misfolding prion proteins that clump in the brain and damage or destroy nerve cells, creating sponge-like holes. Current examples include kuru and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease in humans, and mad cow disease in animals, both of which cause brain deterioration, loss of motor control and ultimately death.\n  \n  In the early 20th century, a kuru epidemic devastated the Fore, a tribe of cannibals in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea. The kuru epidemic was linked to a Fore ritual of feasting on the brains of the dead. In the mid-1950s, Australian authorities banned these feasts. After this, the incidence of kuru declined, and no new cases have cropped up in people born since the ban.\n\n\nNot to mention the psychological effects on cultures that view cannibalism as taboo!\n\nEDIT TO ADD:  In all my survival training, I was never instructed or even suggested to eat other people (or drink my own piss).  Training may differ for the Royal Navy though!\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4731#4733", "answerId": "4733"}

Chapter 14 of this document gives a description of those IQ tests. Research also showed that Koko was able to demonstrate some of the techniques required for abstract thought.\n\n\n  It is hard to draw any firm conclusions about the gorilla\u2019s intelligence\n  as compared to that of the human child. Because infant intelligence\n  tests have so much to do with motor control, results tend to get\n  skewed. Gorillas and chimps seem to gain general control over their\n  bodies earlier than humans, although ultimately children far outpace\n  both in the fine coordination required in drawing or writing. In\n  problems involving more abstract reasoning, Koko, when she is willing\n  to play the game, is capable of solving relatively complex problems. If\n  nothing else, the increase in Koko\u2019s mental age shows that she is\n  capable of understanding a number of the principles that are the\n  foundation of what we call abstract thought. Source: Koko.org\n\nThere have been other apes who have also performed well when intelligence tests were administered apart from Koko. \n\n\n  Over the years other apes have been administered intelligence tests.\n  An orang once reportedly scored about 200 on an infant intelligence\n  test, a result that may have said more about the orang\u2019s faster maturing\n  motor control than its reasoning abilities, although there is\n  no question that oranges are bright. Viki, the female chimp who was\n  the subject of an early attempt to teach spoken language to an ape,\n  was given a number of intelligence tests and performed quite well.\n  She did better than a control group of human infants up to the age of\n  eighteen months, and matched their performance until about age\n  three. Source: Koko.org\n\n\nSome of the famous apes researched for language learning abilities are mentioned here.\nResearch shows that there are differences in cognitive tasks when comparing between apes and young children.\n\n\n  However, shared intentionality plays a role in all cultural learning, making this proposal modular and domain-general at the same time. It is consistent not only with increasing data on differences between apes and young children on cognitive tasks, but also with the idea that unique forms of human cooperation evolved along with and made possible human society and culture. Source: Modularity, comparative cognition and human uniqueness.\n\n\nThere are also differences between human and animal brain structures.\n\n\n  The broad range of cognitive cases, which includes teaching, causal reasoning, short-term memory, planning, TOM, etc., consistently shows fundamental limitations in the animal version of the human competence. There is no anomaly in the disparity\u2014the disparity between human and animal cognition is compatible with the disparity between human and animal brain. Source:Human and animal cognition: Continuity and discontinuity\n\n\n\nMeaning:\n\n\nThe test scores of Koko's IQ is claimed to be 85 to 95 by Patterson.\n\n\n  Koko's IQ has tested at 85-95 with several administrations of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and other such instruments as detailed by Patterson in her dissertation (1979b). This score range resulted in spite of the human cultural bias of the test. which placed Koko at a disadvantage. Source: Speech sound discrimination ability in a Lowland gorilla\n\n\nHowever, these IQ test scores should viewed with caution and should not be subjectively compared to a human child since it was obtained from a one subject longitudinal study and the high or low scores might depend on the primate's cooperation or mood which differs from one ape to another.\n\n\n  With any single-subject study the limitations to making generalizations are obvious. How representative Koko's abilities are of gorillas' potential is anyone's guess at this point since hers is a one-of-a-kind longitudinal\n  study. The literature (Redshaw, 1975; Yerkes &amp; Yerkes, 1929), as well as\n  observations (Patterson &amp; Linden, 1981; personal observations), reflect how different one gorilla's performance can be from another's. Consequently, direct comparisons with child language development--even if theoretically other major variables, such as IQ and age equivalency, could be factored out--need to be made with caution. Source: Speech sound discrimination ability in a Lowland gorilla\n\nCritics of ape studies allege that the ape signs are only for obtaining food or objects and not for exchanging information with the ape's trainer.\n\n\n  Nim's, Washoe's, Ally's, Booee's, and Koko's use of signs suggests  a type of interaction between an ape and its trainer that has  little to do with human language.  In each instance the sole  function of the ape's signing appears to be to request various  rewards that can be obtained only by signing.  Little, if any, evidence is available that an ape signs in order to exchange information with its trainer, as opposed to simply demanding some object or activity. Source: A Philosophical Critical Analysis of Recent Ape-Language Studies\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWe have information only from observational studies about the intelligence of apes and more rigorous studies excluding Clever Hans effects or research bias are needed for confirming whether apes can obtain better IQ scores than human children or adults.  \n\n\n  No matter how much we wish to project ourselves onto them, they are still apes\u2014albeit very intelligent ones. They deserve our respect, and, at the very least, proper care. Our original plan for these apes\u2014to study their capacity for language\u2014has more or less been achieved, and it\u2019s unclear how much more we can learn, as apes like Koko and Kanzi are reaching old age. Through these projects, we\u2019ve learned about the ability of nonhuman apes to associate symbols or signs with objects in the world and to use this knowledge to communicate with humans. We\u2019ve learned about the uniqueness of human language. But we may also have learned something about how strange, stubborn, and fanciful we can be.

It's generally accepted that\n\n\nWalruses are sensitive disturbances like planes flying nearby etc., which have resulted in specific recommendations to people how to avoid disturbing walruses. This quote is for a different event (but from the same year, 2017); the general message on disturbances holds:\n\n\n\n  A survey Monday of a mile of coastline near the Inupiaq Eskimo village of Point Lay found 64 dead walruses, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told The Associated Press.\n  \n  Most of the animals were younger than a year old. The cause of death is not known, said agency spokeswoman Andrea Medeiros, but stampedes\u2014set off when startled walruses rush to the sea, crushing smaller animals\u2014are a likely suspect.\n  \n  \"Our thinking is, because of the age of the animals\u2014they were young animals\u2014it's likely that it was caused by a stampede, probably more likely than disease, given the age class,\" Medeiros said.\n  \n  A polar bear, hunter, airplane or boat can cause a stampede. Alaska Native residents of Point Lay, who may legally hunt walrus for food, expressed concern after seeing an airplane flying near the herd and possibly circling.\n  \n  \"That certainly is a concern,\" Medeiros said. \"That's not what we want people to be doing.\"\n  \n  Fish and Wildlife Service guidelines instruct pilots of single-engine planes to stay at least a half-mile away from walruses on land or ice, and if closer, to fly above 2,000 feet (610 meters).\n  \n  The guidelines call for helicopters and multi-engine aircraft to stay a mile away, or if closer, above 3,000 feet (915 meters). The agency warns that it is only guidance but creating a disturbance is a violation of federal law. [...]\n  \n  Shaye Wolf, climate science director for the Center for Biological Diversity, who wrote the 2008 petition to list walruses as threatened or endangered species, said the Fish and Wildlife Service should review guidelines for protecting walruses.\n  \n  \"These animals are suffering a great deal of stress from climate change, and when they're pushed ashore, they should get very strong protections from disturbances,\" she said.\n  \n  The ultimate threat to walruses is the rapid loss of sea ice due to climate disruption, she said, adding that rollbacks of climate change protections by the Trump administration will further endanger the animals.\n\n\n\nTheir habitat has been reduced by retreating sea ice (strongly associated with global warming). That coupled with apparently a walrus population that has reached carrying capacity of their habitat, it's unsurprising to see them take more often to unsuitable environments, where higher mortality is observed. Since the event your inquire about appears to have happened in the Pacific, here's info on the walrus population there:\n\n\n\n  The latest research indicates that the Pacific walrus population in the Bering and Chukchi seas likely declined throughout the period from about 1980 to 2000 (MacCracken et al. 2014, Taylor and Udevitz 2015). The weight of evidence suggests that this population had actually approached the carrying capacity of their environment in the late 1970s - early 1980s, due to restrictions on subsistence harvests (Fay et al. 1989, 1997, Hills and Gilbert 1994). But, population models suggest a subsequent decline of approximately 50% (Taylor and Udevitz 2015), likely due to changes in vital rates associated with a population at or near carrying capacity. This decline has likely been exacerbated by declines in sea ice, which are associated with global climate change that are reducing the carrying capacity of the environment for walruses (Garlich-Miller et al. 2011, Taylor and Udevitz 2015). Hypothesized mechanisms include (1) the retreat of sea ice to a position over the deep Arctic Ocean basin, forcing walruses to use land-based haulouts where trampling events result in increased mortality to young animals (Jay and Fischbach 2008, Udevitz et al. 2012) and (2) the decline in sea ice reducing walruses' access to prey, which could affect adult female body condition, ultimately reducing calf survival and recruitment (Jay et al. 2011, Taylor and Udevitz 2015). While the use of land-based haulout areas is not novel for walruses, females with dependent young typically utilize sea ice for hauling out (Fay 1982), which allows them to avoid particularly large land-based haulouts where crowding and trampling events can result in large mortality events of dependent young (Fischbach et al. 2009). Unregulated subsistence harvests in the United States and subsistence and commercial harvests in the Russian Federation (commercial harvests ended in 1990) have contributed to declines of Pacific walruses in the past (Fay et al. 1989, Fay and Bowlby 1994). However, since 1992, harvest of this subspecies has been limited to subsistence takes by communities in Alaska and Chukotka (Garlich-Miller et al. 2006) and is currently not considered a threat to the population (USFWS 2011). However, a major remaining concern is the effects of declining sea ice on future energetics of females and young animals that must now make feeding trips from coastal haulouts to areas of high prey abundance (180 km one-way), rather than utilizing nearby ice edges for resting as they did in the past. Current research will hopefully soon shed light on this potential stressor. The status of the Pacific walrus stock in the Laptev Sea is currently unknown (Laidre et al. 2015).\n\n\n\n\nThanks to K Dog for pointing this out, there's newer piece in The Atlantic where more similar, fall events are discussed:\n\n\n  \u201cWalruses have shown similar behavior on the U.S. coastline when space and ice were not an issue, and the reason is unknown,\u201d says Lori Polasek from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. For example, in three successive years, from 1994 to 1996, dozens of male walruses fell to their death from cliffs in southwestern Alaska. But Kochnev and Lanfear argue that the incident captured in Our Planet is exceptional in both the height of the cliffs and the number of walruses that plummeted and died\u2014hundreds as opposed to dozens.\n  \n  The reason for the falls might be complicated, but it\u2019s clear that climate change is affecting the walruses. \u201cWe do believe that haul-outs have increased in size due to the loss of sea ice\u2014in part, due to females and their calves moving to land during summer,\u201d says Nicole Misarti from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\n\n\n\n\nIn this specific incident, there have been allegations in the mass media (mostly from the right side of the political spectrum e.g. in The Australian) that the crew of Our Planet actually spooked the walruses, which the crew denies doing; the Australian quotes them as\n\n\n  Attention now centres on whether the film crew had blocked the walruses\u2019 exit path after they had been spooked by drones used in filming.\n  \n  Documentary-maker Sophie Lanfear defended the film crew\u2019s actions.\n  \n  \u201cWhen approaching the walruses, we made sure we were downwind of them and that we could not be seen,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n  \n  \u201cWe only stood up when it was safe to do so and when we weren\u2019t at risk of scaring any walruses.\u2019\u2019\n  \n  The filmmakers used a walrus behaviour expert supplied by WWF.\n  \n  \u201cFundamentally, the reason walruses used this haul-out location is because of a lack of sea ice in the region, meaning they are coming ashore more frequently than they did in the past,\u201d Ms Lanfear told British media.\n\n\nThe crew has a longer page listing the precautions they took.  I haven't seen wildlife experts saying that those precautions would have been insufficient, although I admit I haven't read the voluminous coverage that this incident seems to get in a certain part of the political spectrum (Breitbart etc.)\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/43747#43753", "answerId": "43753"}

In fresh eggs, only few salmonellas are present and as albumen is an iron-restricted environment, growth will only occur once storage-related changes to vitelline membrane permeability, which allow salmonellas to invade yolk contents, have taken place. When this happens high populations are achieved in both yolk contents and albumen. \n\n\nDo you count that layer as the yolk? If not, strictly, there are more infections in the albumen than the yolk.

The galaxies move so fast that, if there were no invisible matter, they would leave the cluster and we would not be able to observe any such clustering.\nThe rotational speed of stars around a galaxy should drop off as you get further from the centre. Instead it tends to stay almost constant. This implies that there is invisible mass away from the galactic centre. This was first reported by Vera Rubin in 1975.\nGravitational lensing also shows clearly that clusters are surrounded by a halo of invisible matter. It was first proposed by Einstein (who thought it would probably never be observed) ands is now a technique that is routinely used to observe extremely distant galaxies.\nObservations of the Cosmic Microwave Background show that there is a lot of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. As dark matter is only affected by gravity (and possibly the weak force) this has the right characteristics to account for this.\nIn the last decade or so, when computers became powerful enough, modelling of the early universe gives the correct, observed results only if dark matter is included in the simulation.\n\n\nAll these (and many more) reasons are why scientists are convinced dark matter exists.

{"question": "Is drinking a soda as bad or more harmful than smoking a cigarette?", "questionId": "16649", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/16649", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "The claim 'drinking a can of soda is just as bad for you as smoking a cigarette' can be denied on two factors mentioned below.\n\n\nA study researching dietary patterns, food groups, and telomere length in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) in 2008 found no connection between sugar-sweetened soda and telomere length (i.e. shorter telomeres). This can mean that decrease of telomere length which is a useful biomarker of lifetime exposure to environmental and biological stressors and a major factor of study in the claim is not related to soda consumption.\n\n\n\n  Of all the food groups studied, only processed meat intake was significantly associated with telomere length after multivariable adjustment, including adjustment for other food groups. Neither the dietary pattern for fats and processed meat nor the dietary pattern for whole grains and fruit was significantly associated with telomere length after adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors. Additional adjustment for BMI did not change these results. Adjustment for gross family income or more refined categories of educational status [proxies for socioeconomic status (SES)] also did not change these results.\n  \n  Conclusions: Processed meat intake showed an expected inverse association with telomere length, but other diet features did not show their expected associations.\n\n\n\nSmoking-attributable mortality is high when compared to obesity associated  deaths in a large population which is seen by the following example in USA. \"Approximately one-half of the population aged 2 and older consumes sugar drinks on any given day. Studies in children and adults have found that reducing sugary drink consumption can lead to better weight control\" among those who are initially overweight. \"An estimated 42.1 million adults in the United States currently smoke cigarettes and an estimated 3,000 kids each day under the age of 18 try their first cigarette and another 700 become regular, daily smokers\". \n\n\nThese numbers reflect that tobacco use is far worse than consumption of soda in terms of deaths i.e. the population in the U.S. consumes more sugary beverages than smoke cigarettes, yet 440,000 people die every year from tobacco use compared with just 112,000 from obesity. \n\nPer Daniel Engber of Slate, \"drinking a soda a day is not nearly as bad as smoking a pack a day. The paper doesn\u2019t show that the long-term health effects of soda and tobacco are comparable and tobacco is far, far worse than soda. We know (or think we know) that soft drinks are a deadly vice and that they send a toxic dose of sugar straight into our veins. The authors push the story further, saying that soda doesn\u2019t only make us sick, it \u201cages our cells.\u201d And if that\u2019s what soda does, with all its lethal sugar, then \u201ccellular aging\u201d must be something real\u2014a valid measure of our inner rot\". \n\nResearchers from the University of California, San Francisco, took five years studying a sample of 5309 US adults aged 20 to 65 years, with no history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease by a national health survey conducted between 1999 and 2002 comparing extrapolated habits from interviews to their measurements of telomeres to reach the conclusion that soda drinkers had shorter telomeres than non-soda drinkers. A similar study correlating shortened telomeres to processed meat, published in 2008, found no connection whatsoever between carbonated-soda intake and cellular aging.  \n\nThe conclusions of Blackburn, Epel, Lin, Cindy Leung and other collaborators were \"regular consumption of sugar-sweetened sodas might influence metabolic disease development through accelerated cell aging\". However, as the researchers noted, \"association does not demonstrate causation\" as they \"only compared telomere length and sugar-sweetened soda consumption for each participant at a single time point.\"\n\nResearch into cellular aging is based on the fact that a cell\u2019s chromosomes are capped at either ends with telomeres. \"Telomeres are complex structures made up of nucleic acid and protein, located at the ends of chromosomes where they provide a protective cap and maintain the integrity of the genome. Telomeric DNA is gradually lost each time a cell divides, until the length of any given telomere reaches a critical level that triggers cell senescence and death. Average telomere length measured in peripheral blood cells decreases as humans age. Certain enzymes work in the opposite direction that they help rebuild the telomeres and slow that aging down and hence research states telomere length erosion may be a potentially useful biomarker of lifetime exposure to environmental and biological stressors.\"\n\nA 2010 review of 10 studies of telomere length and early death showed that five studies found no relationship between shortened telomeres and increased risk of mortality. \"Different groups also tried and failed to link the length of telomeres with patients\u2019 blood pressure, lung function, and grip strength (an indicator of overall health). More research led to more confusion as some studies did find that shorter telomeres predicted cognitive impairment\u2014cellular aging might predispose to dementia, for example but other analyses found the opposite.\"\n\nAccording to a summary of the field from 2013, it is certain that telomeres get shorter with age and the only proven correlations across research are with age, gender, and race. A study published in 2014 found no evidence of a relationship between telomere length and life stressors.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/16649#28760", "answerId": "28760"}

{"question": "Are religious people happier?", "questionId": "1954", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1954", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "It depends on where you look.  And exactly as people have said, what defines happiness.\n\nAccording to some studies, religious people tend to be happier.\n\n\n  Researchers accidentally discovered that people with religious beliefs tend to be more content in life while studying an unrelated topic. While not the original objective, the recent European study found that religious people are better able to cope with shocks such as losing a loved one or getting laid off of a job.\n\n\nBut then you look at overall country happiness, and very secular, irreligious nations like the Scandinavian nations are rated as the happiest.\n\n\n  \"The Scandinavian countries do really well,\" says Jim Harter, a chief scientist at Gallup, which developed the poll. \"One theory why is that they have their basic needs taken care of to a higher degree than other countries. When we look at all the data, those basic needs explain the relationship between income and well-being.\"\n\n\nI think it is safe to say that religiousness may not be the main factor in determining happiness, rather other factors, and the correlation is incidental.  People searching for a specific correlation and causation will find what they are looking for.  In general, a cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy at work in both cases.\n\nFor instance, in the religious community, there is a ready made support structure in place for religious people.\n\n\n  It's not their spirituality, belief in heaven, or even the ritual act of praying or going to a house of worship that leads the pious to happiness.

{"question": "Are diet soft drinks linked to depression in women?", "questionId": "26862", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/26862", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Summary\n\nI'll go through the papers I used one by one.\n\nChen et al.\n\nDr. Honglei Chen et al. conducted a study for the NIH (later presented at a meeting of the American Academy of Neurology). The study noted that people who regularly drink soda (i.e. four cups or more per day) are 30% more likely to develop depression later in life (and the effect was amplified by diet soda). The authors surveyed over 250,000 people.\n\nThere seemed to be a very strong correlation at work, and given the size of the survey pool, it didn't seem like a fluke. But the researchers were very quick to note - as were critics - that the study was not proof that drinking soda leads to depression. An association is not the same as proof of causality.\n\nWalton et al.\n\nSeveral psychologists monitored 40 patients over a short span. Some had a prior history of depression; others did not. Some in each group took aspartame, a common sweetener. The result showed that those with prior depression were more likely to have it exaggerated by consuming aspartame; those without it showed a slight increase in depression-like symptoms.\n\nLedochowski et al.\n\nThis study is for comparison, because fructose is not used in diet sodas but in regular sodas. I was curious as to whether or not the same symptoms would be found - and, surprisingly, they were.\n\nAustrian researchers studied 53 patients over four weeks. These patients had gastroenterological issues which caused them to have fructose malabsorption. Over the study, women with the condition taking fructose developed several symptoms, including signs of depression. Other health issues were noted.\n\nSo what?\n\nAll three studies seemed to draw a strong conclusion between diet soda/soda (or ingredients in it) and depression, as well as other possible symptoms. There seems to be a strong causal relationship. However, the one downside is that these studies have not been replicated by other groups! The methodology has not been addressed either.\n\nI'm wavering on whether to say yes or no on this. I hate to not draw a definite conclusion, but I have to agree with what many of the articles wrote: More research is needed. But if any of these results are confirmed by another study, then I'd say that there is indeed a good chance that diet soda can cause depression. So I'm leaning towards \"yes\".\n\nNo matter what the answer, it won't hurt you to stop drinking diet soda. Or regular soda for the matter. However, you should always consult a physician before making any (significant) changes to your diet.\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nChen et al.\n\nA study was done by the NIH, which analyzed cases of depression (or lack thereof) in 250,000 adults. georgechalhoub gave quite a nice summary of that study. The media jumped on the story (US News &amp; World report, San Jose Mercury News, The Huffington Post, and, of course, Fox news). Newspapers love stories like this, so I'm not surprised the study made the news. What I was surprised about was that some of the articles said that causality was not truly addressed.\n\nThe Huffington post article was written by Dr. Lisa Young, a nutritionist and adjunct professor at NYU.1 Young wrote\n\n\n  So, what do we make of this study?\n  \n  The study doesn't show that soda causes depression, but rather found an association between the two -- soda drinkers were more likely to be diagnosed with depression. It is important not to confuse the two.\n  \n  Here is what I told the New York Daily News when called to comment on the study:\n  \n  \n    It's hard to tell from this single study what the exact connection between sweetened drinks and mood might be -- but either way, you're better off cutting back, says Lisa Young, Ph.D, R.D., an NYC-based nutritionist and adjunct professor in the department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at NYU.\n    \n    \"I'm not a fan of diet soda, but I don't think it's the soda alone that's causing depression,\" she told the Daily News. \"The thing about soda is, you don't often drink it alone -- you drink it with junk food. You're not getting enough fiber and protein with that sugar, and your blood sugar not being stable could throw off your mood.\"\n    \n    Diet soda drinkers who are focused on weight loss might also be blue from feeling like they're struggling with their weight, she said. \"You're getting that false sense of sweetness, so you're never really satisfied,\" which could lead to continued cravings, she said. \"[The soda] could be safe, but I think it puts you into this pattern of not really eating healthfully.\"\n  \n\n\nAn article on Smithsonian.com also discussed the study2:\n\n\n  Does this mean you should stop drinking diet Coke and starting chugging coffee immediately? Probably not. This type of suggested link between two seemingly unrelated factors is an ideal time to bring up the difference between causation and correlation. Do the ingredients in both diet sodas and normally-sweetened drinks trigger changes in brain chemistry that lead to depression? Or are people with the tendency to become depressed simply more likely to drink these beverages in the first place?\n  \n  Without the full paper, it\u2019s hard to know for sure\u2014we don\u2019t know if the study\u2019s authors controlled for all relevant factors, making sure to compare study participants who were alike in all ways except for their beverage consumption. As a result, a third, unrelated factor may cause people to both drink more soda and become depressed more frequently. Since the study is backward-looking, it\u2019s especially hard to rule this out: The researchers can\u2019t go back to 1996 and make sure to ask the participants every potentially relevant question to ensure that all potentially important factors have been taken into consideration.\n  \n  Additionally, the fact that an association was found for both regular and diet sodas makes a causative link seem less likely. For that to be the case, either both sugar and aspartame must trigger depression, but at different frequencies, or a third ingredient in both sodas is responsible, but is somehow modulated by the presence of the natural or artificial sweetener.\n\n\nAlso interesting was the article in the San Jose Mercury News. Here's a short excerpt:\n\n\n  The researchers do not say that soda causes depression \u2014 they did not determine whether people who are likely to become depressed are also simply more likely to drink soda in the first place, and the study did not control for all relevant factors, such as socioeconomic status. What they did find was that people who drank more than four cans or cups of soda per day were 30 percent more likely to develop depression over the course of the 10-year study than people who drank no soda.\n\n\nlivescience also wrote about it, and touched upon the same things:\n\n\n  The study only found an association, and did not determine whether or not diet soda or fruit drinks caused depression. Although the researchers took into account factors that could affect the results, such as age, sex, education, smoking status, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and energy intake, it's possible other circumstances, such as a family history of depression or stressful life events, could explain the association.\n\n\nNow for a meta-analysis of all that.\n\nI just quoted specific excerpts from the articles discussing the study. Aside from the article written by Dr. Young (and the one she was quoted in), all the articles showed the study in a good light. It got a fairly good reaction.\n\nSmithsonian.com commented that it would be difficult to analyze the study, given that it was not yet available. I still can't seem to find it. Chen has done other work on depression and diet (see here; abstract here).\n\nHold on. Look at part of the livescience quote:\n\n\n  Although the researchers took into account factors that could affect the results, such as age, sex, education, smoking status, physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and energy intake . . .\n\n\nLook at part of the abstract of the study I listed:\n\n\n  . . . adjusted for age, gender, educational level, marital status, smoking, and coffee drinking.\n\n\nThat sounds pretty similar, if not the same. But the paper's not quite the same. Dang. And it doesn't look like any of the papers that cite it are what we're looking for. Neither are any of the papers that this paper cites (of course, the paper we're looking for was published after this one). So it seems that the situation for us is the same as the situation for Smithsonian.com.\n\nFor fun, I'll quote a passage from the article discussing its own methodologys:\n\n\n  Major strengths of our study include the large sample size, long period of exposure assessment, and detailed information on potential confounders and effect modifiers. The analyses were however retrospective in nature. Selection bias cannot be ruled out if depressed individuals with PD were less likely to participate in the follow-up survey compared to depressed individuals without PD; if true the observed odds ratios are likely underestimated. Recall bias could also be a concern as PD patients might be more likely to recall or report depression than the PD-free participants. Although we could not directly evaluate potential impacts from this bias, our additional analysis excluding individuals with poor health status who might be more likely to over report depression, showed similar results. In such a large cohort, we had to rely on the self-report to identify depression and PD diagnoses as well as the years of first diagnoses. Misdiagnosis and under reporting are therefore unavoidable. Our ongoing verification study of PD diagnosis showed that 88% of PD cases were validated with information from their treating neurologists. Although we did not validate self-reported depression, nor did we have data on antidepressant use, in other validation studies self-reported diagnosis of depression was deemed fairly reliable compared to medical record review or specialist interview 16 and self-reports have been used in other longitudinal studies.\n\n\nSo interviewing patients with Parkinson's disease has some issues that can never be adjusted for. How ironic. Some of these problems could crop up in the study we're interested in if similar methods were used, but the issues directly related to PD would not be applicable.\n\nSo the study found that depression and drinking diet soda can go hand-in-hand, but causality was not established. That's my conclusion, as I play devil's advocate here.\n\n\n\nWalton et. al.\n\nI can't find any other studies that discuss the first study (Young's rebuttal doesn't quite count), so I looked at some others.\n\nThis page led me to this page. Which quoted a letter discussing a study. The lengths I go to to get sources for my answers.\n\nAt the core of all these links was an analysis of aspartame, approved by the FDA (according to the latter article):\n\n\n  The FDA approved aspartame for use in certain dry foods in 1981 and for soft drinks in 1983. In 1996, it removed all restrictions, allowing use in all food products, including ones exposed to heat, which separates the main ingredients. The FDA has set an acceptable daily limit of 50 mg per kg of body weight, which assumes that aspartame can safely replace all sucrose sweeteners in the diet.\n\n\nAspartame is a sweetener, used in, among other things, some diet sodas4. Studies have linked it to a whole bunch of health problems (those poor lab rats!).  Dr. Ralph Walton did a study on aspartame in 1993:\n\n\n  Fine, but can those who suffer depression or bipolar disorder be considered part of the general population? In 1993, Dr Walton, who is a psychiatrist, conducted a study of 40 patients with unipolar depression and a similar number without a psychiatric history. The subjects were given 30 mgs per kg of body weight a day of aspartame or a placebo for 20 days (about equal to daily consumption if it completely replaced sugar).\n  \n  Thirteen individuals completed the study, then an institutional review board called the project to a halt \"because of the severity of reactions within the group of patients with a history of depression.\" In a smaller, shorter crossover design, \"again there was a significant difference between aspartame and placebo in number and severity of symptoms for patients with a history of depression, whereas for individuals without such a history there was not.\"\n  \n  Accordingly, the author concluded that \"individuals with mood disorders are particularly sensitive to this artificial sweetener and its use in this population should be discouraged.\"\n  \n  As to further particulars of the study, based on the eight depressed subjects and five healthy subjects who completed it:\n  \n  Three quarters of the patients with a history of depression taking aspartame reported feeling depressed vs none of the healthy subjects taking aspartame and about 40 percent of both groups taking a placebo. The 40 percent is probably a statistical aberration owing to the small numbers who completed the study. Nevertheless, the figures consistently show the depressed/aspartame group experiencing an array of symptoms in far greater numbers and severity, including: fatigue, nausea, headache, trouble remembering, insomnia, and other symptoms.\n\n\nWow. That seems pretty definitive. Yet the article fully admits that peer review is necessary:\n\n\n  Remarkably, Dr Walton\u2019s study is the only one we have related to both mood and aspartame. It would be helpful to get a second opinion, but no one else since, apparently, has tried to either replicate or refute his results. This may be due to the political and funding climate. \"The NutraSweet company,\" Dr Walton told this writer, \"clearly tried to block our study.\"\n\n\nAh, sounds like the cigarette companies. But something in me doubts that Walton's explanation is the full story, although it could very well be true. Conclusion: More peer review is needed, but it seems pretty conclusive. If it's right.\n\nThere are, of course, other articles discussing the study. This one is a letter written by Dr. Walton. In it, he writes:\n\n\n  That study was published in Biological Psychiatry in 1993 (a copy of the paper is enclosed). It demonstrated that individuals with mood disorders are particularly sensitive to aspartame and experienced an accentuation of depression and multiple physical symptoms. I had expected that the difficulties experienced by patients receiving aspartame would be fairly subtle (the dose of 30mg/kg/day was well below the 50mg/kg/day that the F.D.A. considered \"safe\"). I was not prepared for the severity of the reactions and for obvious ethical reasons cannot perform any further human studies with aspartame.\n  \n  Two years after the publication of that study I was contacted by a producer for \"60 Minutes\" and asked if I would be willing to be interviewed by Mike Wallace for a segment on aspartame. During that interview Mike challenged me on my assertion that there were major problems with this sweetener in view of the fact that the bulk of the medical literature attested to it's safety.\n  \n  I responded that one had to look carefully at study funding - that virtually all of the studies claiming safety were funded by the industry, whereas independently funded studies invariably identified one or more problems. When he challenged me to prove this I prepared a chart correlating study outcome and funding source. This chart was aired on the 60 Minutes segment, and is enclosed, with further discussion of this entire issue.\n\n\nThat might be an interesting interview to watch. Perhaps I can find a transcript.\n\nArticle #2 is also a letter. And a very opinionated one, too. I don't have room (or time, I think) to summarize it, but it gives a lot of different studies regarding the effects of aspartame.\n\nArticle #3 is written by the same person (Dr. Betty Martini), this time to Florida State University. It rehashes the same points . . . but it links to Walton's study (co-authored by Robert Hudak and Ruth J. Green-Waite, who seem to have missed out on the excitement)!\n\nLet's look over it, shall we?\n\n\n  The project design called for the recruitment of 40 patients with a history of treatment for recurrent major depression, currently doing wall with a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (RPRS) rating of no greater than 6 at the time of the study. Subjects were recruited by word of mouth, and by a posting and distribution of the study protocol and informed-consent statements among patients, attending physicians, administrative and nursing staff, and medical students at the Western Reserve Care System.\n\n\nNot the best recruiting system. Note also that the study only showed that patients with depression could have that depression worsened by aspartame. That's not quite the same as directly linking aspartame to depression in otherwise happy individuals.\n\nAlso, the NutraSweet company didn't do too much to block the study:\n\n\n  NutraSweet Company denied the request from the authors to purchase aspartame.\n\n\nThat's it.\n\n\n  Each participant monitored his own symptoms using a checklist, one of which was provided for each week of the study. Listed symptoms were: headache, nervousness, dizziness, trouble remembering, binge eating, lower back pain, nausea or upset stomach, feeling blue or depressed, insomnia, uncontrollable temper outburst, and other (to be specified by the subject). For each symptom the participant had to assign the following point value on a daily basis: 0 = not present; 1 = mild (symptom occurs but does not disrupt activities); 2 = moderate (symptom occurs but can be controlled whether by medication or other means; 3 = severe (symptom occurs and disrupts daily activities).\n\n\nEach participant monitored his own symptoms . . .

In this study even people who believed that they had problems with aspartame (three of the nondepressed volunteers) did not demonstrate significant differences from placebo, whereas patients with a history of depression and no awareness of aspartame intolerance did demonstrate significant adverse reactions. Although there are some long-term studies, (Leone et al 1989) 1- or 2-day challenges, such as those of Schiffman et al (1987), may not be long enough for difficulties to emerge. In this study, patients most often began to report significant symptoms after day 2 or 3. A 1- or 2-day challenge also does not replicate common patterns of daily consumption.\n\n\n\n\nLedochowski et al.\n\nI found a third study on the website of Psychology Today. It was conducted by researchers in Europe, but it studied the effects of regular soda, not diet soda.\n\n\n  Turns out that in Central Europe, a large percentage (30-50%) of the population suffers from certain types of carbohydrate malabsorption .  I asked a friend of mine, an academic gastroenterologist who just left Johns Hopkins, what she thought the percentage of Americans was, and she felt it was 15-20%.  In fructose malabsorption(link is external), the GLUT5 transporter in the small intestine doesn't take up fructose as efficiently as it could.  That means lots of undigested fructose floats down to the colon, feeding the bacteria there and leading to bloating, cramping, and diarrhea - basically the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. It is diagnosed via testing for excess hydrogen in the exhaled breath after a fructose load of 50mg. A similar test can show if someone has lactose intolerance.\n  \n  Well, the researchers in Central Europe took a hundred or so \"otherwise healthy volunteers\" who had complained about gastrointestinal distress at a doctor's visit. None were on medication (except oral contraception) or had any signs of chronic or serious illness. They were given a standard scale test for depression (the Beck Depression Inventory) a fructose malabsorption test, then, a week later, a lactose malabsorption test.\n  \n  Let's cut to the chase - a positive test for fructose malabsorption corresponded to depressed women, but not men. Lactose malabsorption alone didn't matter in either sex, but the 12% of women in the study who were both fructose and lactose malabsorption positive were by far the most depressed. The normal female controls had an average depression score of 7.5 - the combined malabsorption women had an average score of 14.6. That's a huge difference, and the data between the unaffected individuals and the carbohydrate malabsorbers hardly overlap at all.\n\n\nAha! Finally, something that says that women are affected by sugars (fructose, in this case). And there's an explanation:\n\n\n  Turns out that fructose (and lactose) can react chemically with tryptophan, the amino acid precursor for our important happy chemical, serotonin. The sugars can degrade tryptophan so that there isn't as much available to be absorbed into the body. And, indeed, fructose malabsorbers have lower levels of tryptophan in the serum than normal controls. And, hey, turns out they have lower serum zinc and folic acid too - both of these findings are associated with depression.\n  \n  But why would the symptoms of depression be confined to women? The researchers postulated that estrogen made the big difference. Estrogen activates an enzyme called hepatic tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase that shifts the metabolism of tryptophan from making serotonin (happy) to making kynurenic (not happy). Women already have lower serum levels of tryptophan than men do (which may be part of the reason why we are more vulnerable to depression in the first place), so screwing up whatever available tryptophan in the diet with fructose may lead to even lower levels, and thus depression.\n\n\nOnce again, the lack of peer review is troubling:\n\n\n  Well.  All of that is observational data, and correlation does not equal causation.  All we have to hang our hats on is a small study from Austria in 2000.  In this study, folks with known fructose malabsorption were put on a low-fructose diet, which reduced their depression scores by 65% after 4 weeks.  The findings were more pronounced in women than in men.\n\n\nI looked up the study, whose abstract can be found here. Something interesting is noted in the abstract:\n\n\n  Fifty-three adults (12 males, 41 females)\n\n\nNow, the number of women in the study shouldn't affect the percentage, but still. That's quite the disparate comparison.\n\nI was able to get the study on a pdf.\n\n\n  Patients\n  \n  From 100 patients who presented at our office for a medical health check, 53 individuals with gastrointestinal complaints were consecutively chosen to participate in this follow-up study on the basis of the H2-breath test results (see below). Sigmoideoscopy was previously performed in most of these patients because of chronic gastrointestinal complaints, and negative results were reasons for a further checkup in our office. For those who had not had sigmoideoscopy, this examination was prescribed to rule out inflammatory bowel diseases. The otherwise healthy outpatients, aged from 17 to 75 years (mean, 44.8  14.5), gave informed consent to participate in the clinical trial with fructose-reduced diet which was approved by the local ethics committee. There were 12 male (range, 23\u201375 years; mean 42.3  14.6) and 41 female patients (range, 17\u201373 years; mean, 45.6  14.6).\n\n\nNo information is given as to how these 100 made it to the office, so the applicant pool cannot be fully analyzed.\n\n\n  Diagnosis of fructose malabsorption was established by H2-breath test after oral fructose load with 50 g fructose given in 250 ml of tap water. All H2-breath tests were performed between 0800h and 0830h after a 12-h overnight fast. Breath-H2 was measured using a Bedfont gastrolizer (Bedfont Ltd., Kent, UK), which had been validated by several authors (11\u201313). Breath-H2 was monitored before fructose load and in 30 min intervals for at least 2 h after fructose load. Maximum breath-H2 concentrations were registered and the differences from baseline values were calculated yielding the operating parameter DH2.\n\n\nHere's the paper's meta-analysis:\n\n\n  In this study, no control group could be included, because most of the studied subjects had gastrointestinal complaints, and we could not stay away from dietary interventions for ethical reasons. Thus, it cannot fully be excluded that a placebo effect could have contributed to the observed amelioration of symptoms, e.g. the improvement of BDI after dietary change. However, the first set of data was obtained at the end of the pre-intervention period, and the patients were asked to estimate the parameters of gastrointestinal symptoms using an arbitrary analogous scale retrospectively. During this period it is unlikely that the individuals changed their dietary behavior, therefore one can consider the study presented here as a preliminary follow-up investigation which outlines the consequences of a fructose-reduced diet. Furthermore, a dietary observation period of 4 weeks may compensate a potential bias owing to instantaneous amelioration of symptoms. Because all scores were measured exactly 4 weeks apart, it can be ruled out that in females the menstrual cycle would have had a major influence on the outcome of depression scores or meteorism scores.\n\n\n\n\n1 I say this to emphasize that she's not just a layman.

{"question": "Should a healthy adult take a daily multi-vitamin?", "questionId": "299", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/299", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "There answer is not necessarily a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nWay too little of a vitamin is a terrible thing, and way too much can be just as bad, although you must reach rather high levels to contract vitamin intoxication. A \"what's the harm\" attitude towards multivitamins is arguably defensible, as you're not running a risk of vitamin intoxication from following the recommended dosage. It rather boils down to whether or not you're willing to spend the money and go through the daily routine, when it's not at all obvious that you should need to.\n\nVitamin supplements are all about avoiding a vitamin deficiency. There really is no added benefit to getting more vitamins once you're at sufficient levels. The trick is that it's not that easy to keep track of whether or not you are. \n\nThe rule cannot be generalized into saying \"Healthy adults don't need vitamin supplements, because in order to be healthy, you must not have a vitamin deficiency.\" You're not likely to catch scurvy unless you're doing something terribly wrong. That's not what this is all about. There can be more subtle effects of small vitamin deficiencies. Vitamins can help you fend off other diseases, for instance:\n\n\n  Vitamin D from a multivitamin or single supplement can lower the risk of colon and possibly many other cancers. * harvard.edu\n\n\nThe process of self-diagnosis should not simply be \"Do I suffer from scurvy? No; ergo I'm getting all the vitamin C I need.\" Rather, you should be asking my self \"Am I avoiding colon cancer as best I can?\" That question is trickier to answer.\n\nNo, you do not need vitamin supplements if you get sufficient levels of vitamins anyway. There is no added benefit to getting more than enough vitamins. But I can't generalize that into \"eating a healthy and balanced diet\", as per your question. First of all, that phrase probably entails different specific details depending on the individual. But, more importantly, I'd like to stress that it's not all about your diet. The richest source of vitamin D, for instance, is exposure to the sun.\n\n\n  If you live north of the line connecting San Francisco to Philadelphia and Athens to Beijing, odds are that you don't get enough vitamin D. The same holds true if you don't get outside for at least a 15-minute daily walk in the sun. African-Americans and others with dark skin, as well as older individuals, tend to have much lower levels of vitamin D, as do people who are overweight or obese. * harvard.edu\n\n\nIt is worth looking into whether or not you belong to any of the risk groups, to assess whether or not you would be in need of supplements, or perhaps, and preferably, a change of habits. For a healthy adult to take multi-vitamins sounds to me like hedging your bets, but a pill a day won't get you intoxicated either.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/299#304", "answerId": "304"}

Nothing in your question implies that he has incorrectly characterized the prevailing scientific views at the time. \n\nConnolley cites a 1975 NAS report as more representative of the scientific (not media) consensus of the time. You can read the forward here. This report notes that scientists were not confident in their ability to predict climate trends back then:\n\n\n  Unfortunately, we do not have a good quantitative understanding of our climate machine and what determines it's course. Without this fundamental understanding, it does not seem possible to predict climate-neither in short-term variations nor in any in its larger long-term changes.\n\n\nThe paper you cite is one assertion that \"global cooling\" is possible. It is not a consensus. One or two assertions don't make a consensus, especially a paper like Rasool and Schneider, which is riddled with flaws. There appear to have been other scientists with similar concerns, and perhaps fewer analytic errors in their work, as well, but again, a handful of people don't make a \"consensus.\"\n\nCherry picking one or two examples which happen to run against the prevailing scientific views at the time -- which were, in short, that climatologists in 1975 were not confident in their ability to predict climate changes at all -- in no way suggests any kind of consensus. There is no credible claim of a consensus for global cooling in your question, only a dodgy paper and an unsupported assertion. \n\nConnolley's own conclusion, from reading the papers cited, is as follows:\n\n\n  Finally, its clear that there were concerns, perhaps quite strong, in the minds of a number of scientists of the time. And yet, the papers of the time present a clear consensus that future climate change could not be predicted with the knowledge then available. Apparently, the peer review and editing process involved in scientific publication was sufficient to provide a sober view. This episode shows the scientific press in a very good light; and a clear contrast to the lack of any such process in the popular press, then and now.\n\n\nRegarding your partial-sentence quote from Peterson, Connolley, and Fleck, let's look at the whole sentence, in context:\n\n\n  Indeed, the Earth appeared to have been cooling for more than 2 decades when scientists first took note of the change in trend in the 1960s. The seminal work was done by J. Murray Mitchell [in 1963, showing that] global temperatures had increased fairly steadily from the 1880s, the start of his record, until about 1940, before the start of a steady multidecade cooling (Mitchell 1963). By the early 1970s, when Mitchell updated his work (Mitchell 1972), the notion of a global cooling trend was widely accepted, albeit poorly understood.\n\n\nIt is quite clear, in context, that this refers to the post-1940s cooling rather than to supposed predictions of a new ice age. Today it is understood that this (ultimately temporary) drop was due to aerosols and industrial pollution and was mainly a Northern Hemisphere, rather than a global trend. But yes, it's correct to say that scientists in the seventies agreed that there was cooling from the 40s through the early 70s, and, with the caveats noted above, they still do. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5057#5098", "answerId": "5098"}

{"question": "Is stevia detrimental to reproductive function?", "questionId": "40426", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40426", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Stevia, the herb,  is used as a general health drink tisane in local native populations and their reproductive behaviour seems to be quite ordinary.\n\nSome Western regulatory bodies seemed to be relatively unconvinced whether an exotic herb would be even less toxic than the chemical industry's well-trusted aspartame.\n\nThe actual use of stevia as birth control does not look too far fetched or too strange in the spectrum of different methods tried so far. Its effectiveness for that purpose seems very doubtful. Although there are some old reports that do note the use of stevia as a contraceptive agent by indeginous people:\n\n\n  Plants used as means of abortion, contraception, sterilization and ecundation by Paraguayan indigenous people(1977): Plan~ and Kue (1968) mention the contraceptive properties of Stevia rebaudiana Bert. (\"ka'a he'e') used by the indigenous tribes of the Paraguayan Mato Grosso. (Cf Contraceptive Properties of Stevia rebaudiana)\n\n\nIn recent years these isolated findings are apparently either forgotten by researchers, not replicated or just quoted without reference. \n\nBut after trying really hard to paint a bad picture of this plant these reproductive effects seem really quite the opposite in reasonable doses:\n\n\n  Reproductive effects\n  At doses of 0.75 g/kg body weight/day, steviol is toxic to pregnant hamsters and their fetuses when given on days six through ten of gestation (Wasuntarawat et al. 1998). Steviol produces decreased maternal weight gain and high maternal mortality. The number of live births per litter is decreased and the mean fetal weight is lower. The no effect dose is 0.25 g/kg body weight/day. If 100% conversion of stevioside to steviol is assumed, this intake is equivalent to 625 mg/kg/day of stevioside. This is about 80 times the acceptable daily intake calculated by Xili et al. (1992). (From A. Douglas Kinghorn: \"Stevia\n  The Genus Stevia\", Taylor &amp; Francis: London, New York, 2002, 172.)\n\n\nIt is indeed likely that for several decades the identity, ethnobotany, taxonomy and natural habitat for the species were all a bit unclear: \n\n\n  Pio Corre\u0302a (1926) in his Diccionario das Plantas Uteis do Brasil, without documentation, mentioned that a sweet plant referred to by him as S. collina Gardn., under the name of \u2018Caa\u0301-Ehe\u0301\u2019, and a variety of this species, var. rebaudiana, are found in the Brazilian Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais. This report is erroneous. First, S. collina, a definitely Brazilian species, and S. rebaudiana are two different species; second, organoleptic tests by the author of leaves of S. collina did not present any sweet taste (Soejarto et al. 1982), while TLC and HPLC, followed by GC/MS analysis (Kinghorn et al. 1984) did not show the presence of steviol glycosides. In a 1967 paper, von Schmeling described a search of S. rebaudiana in Mato Grosso, the Brazilian territory bordering the northeastern Paraguay\u2019s Cordillera of Amambay, where the species occurs. She reported that the search resulted in the collection of the plant in Ponta-Pora, the Brazilian town adjacent to PJC, the capital city of the Department of Amambay of Paraguay. She stated: Encontramo-la, defato, em Ponta-Pora, divisado Brasilcomo Paraguai (von Schmeling 1967:68) (\u2018Indeed, we found the plant in Ponta-Pora, in the border between Brazil and Paraguay\u2019). The search crew returned to Sa\u0303o Paulo with a \u2018beautiful plant in a pot, a proof that the caa\u0301-hee\u0302 plant is also found in Brazil.\u2019 According to her account, this potted plant eventually gave off beautiful flowers in Sa\u0303o Paulo and, based on the examination performed on 23 November 1944, at the Institute of Botany of the State of Sa\u0303o Paulo, the identity of the potted plant as \u2018the same Stevia plant\u2019 (\u2018...se tratava mesmo da Stevia\u2019) (sic!) was confirmed. Unfortunately, no mention at all is made anywhere in the paper that this discovery of the Stevia plant in Ponta-Pora was documented, namely, whether herbarium specimen(s) were prepared and whether it (they) have been deposited in a herbarium institution, giving the name of the institution, for future reference, as the botanical evidence of the finding. During the author\u2019s 1981 trip, he crossed the border to Ponta-Pora, and made inquiries on the possible existence of natural populations of Caa\u0301-he\u0302-he\u0302 or Caa\u0301-enhem in Ponta-Pora. He also went to an excursion to the fields some distance away from this town. To his disappointment, no sign of the presence of S. rebaudiana was found. To complicate matters, Sumida in his 1973 paper states that S. rebaudiana, with local names of \u2018Caa\u0301-he\u0302-he\u0302 or Caa\u0301-enhem\u2019, has been used \u2018...in some localities of Brazil from old times as a sweetening material\u2019. Like von Schmeling, no botanical documentation to support the statement appears to exist. Interestingly, Felippe (1977), a biologist at the Instituto de Bota\u0301nica in Sa\u0303o Paulo, stated that \u2018A planta [S. rebaudiana] foi introduzida no Brasil na de\u0302cada de 60. A. instituciao responsave\u0302l pel a introduca\u0302o foi o Instituto do Bota\u0302nica de Sa\u0303o Paulo\u2019. (\u2018The plant was introduced to Brazil in the decade of the 1960s. The institution responsible for its introduction was the Institute of Botany of Sa\u0303o Paulo.\u2019) This statement contradicts the finding described by von Schmeling and the statement made by Sumida. (p 31\u201332.)\n\n\nThe identity of the plant material allegedly used as a contraceptive is therefore in doubt and the non-replication easily explainable. Recent studies on properly identified plants, extracts and constituents do not find any adverse effects, except for possible allergies or really extreme doses. To the contrary, many findings seem to indicate that consuming stevia might be more beneficial beyond giving a sweet taste.\n\n\n  Safety Evaluation of Aqueous Extracts from Aegle Marmelos and Stevia Rebaudiana on Reproduction of Female Rats: (2006)\n  Much of the controversy surrounding the existing literature on stevia results from inadequate research aimed at reproduction of both laboratory animals and human beings. The results of the present study clearly indicate the non-toxic effect of S. rebaudiana on the reproduction of female rats.\n  Dominant lethal testing also revealed that the aqueous extracts of these 2 plants had no toxic effects on male rats\u2019 reproduction or progeny outcome (Aritajat et al, 2000). It is concluded that the aqueous extract of A. marmelos and S. rebaudiana at all doses used in this study had no adverse effects on female rat reproduction, and had no teratogenic effects.\n  \n  Stevia rebaudiana Bertani does not produce female reproductive toxic effect: Study in Swiss albino mouse: (2008)\n  This study reports that the oral intake of water-based sweet stevia extract and stevioside, at doses 500mg/kg body weight and 800mg/kg body weight, respectively, does not cause any significant female reproductive toxic effect in Swiss albino mouse.\n  \n  Overview: The history, technical function and safety of rebaudioside A, a naturally occurring steviol glycoside, for use in food and beverages:(2008)\n  Rebaudioside A is a sweet tasting steviol glycoside extracted and purified from Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni). Steviol glycosides can currently be used as a food ingredient in only a handful of countries. Questions on specifications, safety and special population effects have prevented steviol glycosides from obtaining a legal status permitting their use as a sweetener in most countries. A set of papers reporting results of research studies and reviews has been compiled in this Supplement to definitively answer unresolved questions. Specifically, recently completed studies on the general and reproductive toxicity of rebaudioside A corroborate studies carried out with purified steviol glycosides demonstrating safety at high dietary intake levels. Comparative metabolism studies provide further affirmation of the common metabolic pathway for all steviol glycosides and the common metabolism between rats and humans. Finally, clinical studies provide further evidence that purified rebaudioside A has no effect on either blood pressure or glucose homeostasis. This paper summarizes the information used to conclude that high purity rebaudioside A (rebiana) produced to food-grade specifications and according to Good Manufacturing Practices is safe for human consumption under its intended conditions of use as a general purpose sweetener.\n  \n  Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, source of a high-potency natural sweetener:\n  A comprehensive review on the biochemical, nutritional and functional aspects: (2012)\n  A number of studies have demonstrated that oral in- take of stevioside has no effect on fertility, neither in mice (Akashi &amp; Yokoyama, 1975), nor in rats (Mori, Sakanoue, Takcuchi, Shimpo, &amp; Tanabe, 1981; Xili et al., 1992), nor in hamsters (Yodyingyuad &amp; Bunyawong, 1991). Adverse effects of stevia have not really been observed. Its commercialisation, in France for example, as a food or a food ingredient has been prohibited based mainly on economical arguments and not on proven adverse health effects (Serio, 2010). However, it is thought that stevia could provoke allergic reactions in people sensitive to plants of the Asteraceae family and it is also recommended that pregnant women should avoid consuming stevia (Serio, 2010).\n  They are non-fermentative low-calorie, non-toxic sweeteners, flavour enhancing and have been tested objectively, based on direct observations on human and animals, showing them to be non-mutagenic, non-teratogenic and non-carcinogenic. Stevia has been consumed by human beings for centuries without any negative effects. This showed the advantages of stevia over other artificial sweeteners as an ingredient for the food industry, thereby making Stevia a more suitable substitute for saccharose in different drinks, beverages and bakery products. Apart from the sweet contents, S. rebaudiana with its secondary plant constituents also offers therapeutic benefits, having anti-hyperglycaemic, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antitumour, anti-diarrhoeal, diuretic, and immunomodulatory effects.\n\n\nA similar assessment concludes:\n\n\n  If stevia were an effective and safe  contraceptive, wouldn\u2019t we all be using it?\n  As stevia has been confirmed to be non-toxic by numerous toxicological studies, it is likely that if the contraceptive effect of stevia were real, researchers would have long ago discovered that fact and isolated the compounds responsible.  That no studies have been able to reliably and repeatably confirm this, is a strong indication that the contraceptive properties of stevia are just unfounded folklore.  The first study to imply a contraceptive effect from stevia was published in 1968, in the early days of pharmaceutical contraceptives and the flower power revolution.  Contraception was a hot topic then.  If there was substance to these claims they would very likely have been thoroughly researched by more than one team of scientists with the objective of adding to the growing arsenal of chemical contraception options. \n\n\nConclusion\n\nStevia seems not to be detrimental for reproductive health, its use as a contraceptive in far away places seems to have at least decreased, if it was ever reported correctly. Recent findings do not corroborate this contraceptive effect.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/40426#40434", "answerId": "40434"}

A common cause of\n  folliculitis is recently shaved hairs re-growing out of the follicle\n  and curling back around to irritate the skin. It is interesting to\n  note that the lack of hair around the anus will make it impossible to\n  pass gas silently.\n  \n  \n  If you're planning on keeping your pubic area smooth and hairless, you\n  will need to shave regularly, even daily. You should consider if this\n  is worth the trouble; what is appealing now may not be after four or\n  five weeks of daily shaving. \n  \n  In addition to being time-consuming, the maintenance can be costly\n  since you need to invest in special shaving equipment and care like a\n  new razor, female shaving cream, baby oil, and/or aloe vera cream.\n\n\nI would like to reiterate that shaving is a personal choice. Some people do risky things, like anal sex or driving while texting. If a person does not want to take big risks, then it is best for that person to consult a medical provider or work with a professional or seek an easier, low-risk alternative. \n\nI wholesomely agree with the same author's advice. Think for yourself. What is popular is not always right, and what is right is not always popular.\n\n\n  Shaving the pubic area has become much more common, even desirable,\n  among teenagers and young adults. Although shaving may be becoming the\n  social norm, that does not mean you should do it.\n\n\nThe author's claims have some back-up from a peer-reviewed journal. \n\nSource: Basow, S. A. (1991). THE HAIRLESS IDEAL. Women and Their Body Hair. Psychology Of Women Quarterly, 15(1), 83-96.\n\n\n  A major component of ``femininity'' in the United States today is a\n  hairless body, a norm that developed in the United States between\n  1915-1945. Little has been written regarding the development of this\n  norm, and virtually no empirical research has been done to assess how\n  universally ascribed to is this standard or why women actually remove\n  their leg and underarm hair. More than 200 women from two national\n  professional organizations responded to a mailed questionnaire\n  (response rate 56%). The majority (around 80%) remove their leg and/or\n  underarm hair at lead occasionally. Two types of reasons for shaving\n  emerged: feminine/attractiveness reasons and social/normative reasons.\n  Most women start shaving for the latter reasons but continue to shave\n  for the former reasons. Certain groups, however, were least likely to\n  remove leg and/or underarm hair: strongly feminist women and\n  self-identified lesbians.\n\n\nConclusion: Whether or not shaving pubic hair is \"bad\" for you must be judged on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, it is highly recommended that one seeks professional or medical help before shaving off pubic hair, if one is concerned about serious repercussions. Remember, it's a personal choice. Also, remember that personal choices or popular choices are sometimes not the best or safest choices in the long run.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19198#19286", "answerId": "19286"}

The latter is known, and all of these answers ultimately cite chess experts, only varying in their interpretation of their figures.\n\nI like the answer from Douglas S. Stones the most as it is the most original. It constructs a move tree that by itself exceeds the number of atoms in the universe, thus directly answering the question.\n\nDavePhD also has the quotes laid out most explicitly, showing that my reliance on the Wolfram site was wrong.\n\n\n\nEdit: I'll leave the original as it stands, but want to add a correction thanks to Mike Dunlavey's comment. I misread the question and thus if the question is, indeed, asking whether games lasting 40 moves or less (I read 40 moves or more) is greater than the number of atoms in the universe, I'm switching my answer to disagree. The numbers are all there below, but now we're comparing 10^80 (# of atoms) vs. 10^43 (# of 40 move or less chess games). Thus the number of atoms is greater.\n\n\n\nI would agree.\n\nFirst, Wiki provides this figure on the number of atoms in the universe:\n\n\n  Two approximate calculations give the number of atoms in the observable universe to be close to 10^80.\n\n\nNext, Wiki provides the Shannon number as the number of possible chess games that can be played:\n\n\n  The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as 10^120, a number known as the Shannon number.\n\n\nLastly, Wolfram Mathworld provides a figure for the number of games less than 40 moves:\n\n\n  The number of possible games of 40 moves or less P(40)  is approximately 10^40 (Beeler et al. 1972) ...Shannon (1950) gave the estimate: P(40) = 64! / (32! * 8!^2 * 2!^6) = 10^43.\n\n\nI see some other answers have come in while I've been typing. They seem to compare total possible games (10^120) to the number of atoms in the universe (10^80), but you're looking for the number of atoms compared to games longer than 40 moves. In that case, we look at:\n\n10^80 vs. 10^120 - 10^43 (to be conservative)\n\nTo be fair, the poster's (@Vian) own answer is correct, as 10^43 doesn't even dent 10^120 and thus it's still essentially comparing 10^80 and 10^120. Just wanted to spell out why I think the question is slightly different than just comparing # of atoms and # of all possible chess games.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4165#4172", "answerId": "4172"}

{"question": "Is low emotional intelligence associated with right-wing and prejudiced attitudes?", "questionId": "44952", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44952", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "The short answer\n\nThe study in question (Van Hiel et al. 2019) has been published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal. It presents empirical support for the hypothesis that emotional abilities negatively correlate with right-wing attitudes. This answers the question in the title.\n\nThe question body also asks about the link between cognitive abilities and right-wing attitudes. This link is assumed by Van Hiel et al. (2019) on the basis of a meta-analysis by Onraet et al (2015), also published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal. The meta-analysis finds significant small-to-medium evidence for a negative relation between cognitive abilities and right-wing attitudes.\n\nThe long answer\n\nThe \"Belgian study\" that the question mentions is \"The Relationship Between Emotional Abilities and Right-Wing and Prejudiced Attitudes\" by Van Hiel et al. (2019). It was published by the academic journal Emotion, one of the journals of the American Psychological Association. According to its Wikipedia article, the journal ranks 15th out of 85 journals in the category \"Psychology, Experimental\". \n\nThe primary reference in the study for the claim that cognitive ability is negatively related to right-wing attitudes and prejudice is the meta-analysis \"The association of cognitive ability with right-wing ideological attitudes and prejudice: A meta-analytic review\" by Onraet et al. (2015), https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2027, published in the European Journal of Personality. According to the Wikipedia article, this journal \"ranked second of all empirical journals in the social-personality field, and first when looking at journals exclusively devoted to research on personality\". The study by Onraet et al. (2015) found a medium-sized, but significant relation between cognitive ability and ideological attitudes. From their conclusion:\n\n\n  The present meta-analysis reveals relationships of small-to-moderate strength between (lower) cognitive ability and right-wing ideology and prejudice. These findings further enforce the call of Hodson and Busseri (2012) that \"...cognitive\n  abilities, particular in relationship to ideology, need to become increasingly focal to and integrated into existing literatures\" (p. 193). \n\n\nNote that the study by Hodson and Busseri (2012) is the one that the accepted answer to the other question is referencing. Effectively, the meta-analysis supports their findings that there is a link between right-wing attitudes and cognitive attitudes. Yet, note that the authors make sure to put this result into perspective: the effect size is described as \"small-to moderate\". In lay terms, this may be translated as \"of course there are many other things affecting right-wing ideology and prejudice, but our analysis provides solid evidence that lower cognitive ability is a measurable factor\".\n\nThis is the background on which Van Hiel et al. (2019) claim that \n\n\n  people with fewer cognitive resources are more likely to adhere to social-cultural right-wing attitudes and tend to be more prejudiced toward ethnic minority groups, whereas those higher in cognitive abilities are more likely to endorse left-wing beliefs and to be less prejudiced (Van Hiel et al. 2019: 917).\n\n\nTheir article investigates the question whether emotional abilities are also aligned with ideological attitudes. Their first study (N=409) relates the results from standardized tests of emotional abilities and the results from different tests that elicit right-wing and prejudiced attitudes. They find that individuals scoring low on emotional abilities were significantly higher in on the scores indicating increasing right-wing attitudes, even if controlling for age, sex, and education.\n\nTheir second study (N=574) additionally incorporates tests of cognitive abilities. The results appear to agree with the results from their first study. Their analyses reveal that\n\n\n  both emotional and cognitive abilities were significant predictors of RWA [=right-wing authoritarianism] and blatant prejudice. For SDO [=social dominance orientation], emotional abilities were the only significant, unique predictor, whereas for subtle prejudice only cognitive abilities were a significant, unique predictor (Van Hiel et al. 2019: 920).\n\n\nVan Hiel et al. (2019: 920) conclude that their results\n\n\n  corroborate the hypothesis that people with lower emotional abilities are more likely to be found at the right-wing side of the ideological spectrum, whereas those having higher emotional abilities are more likely to endorse left-wing beliefs. Second, compared to cognitive abilities, emotional abilities are an at least equally potent correlate of such attitudes. [...] Finally, emotional abilities, but not cognitive abilities, were related to economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes.\n\n\nAs good scientific publications should, the authors point out some limitations of their study. For instance, they emphasize that their study is a cross-sectional study that yields correlational data, which forbids making inferences of causality. They propose that future longitudinal studies or experimental studies should address this. Also, they found the effect of emotion recognition to be weaker in their second study, thus calling for replication studies.\n\nSo, to summarize: There is little reason to doubt that the studies (Van Hiel et al. 2019, Onraet et al. 2015) meet the current standards of personality research as they are published in reputable academic journals relevant to the field. The newer study finds a negative link between emotional abilities and right-wing attitudes, and it confirms the negative link between cognitive abilities and right-wing attitudes that is reviewed in the older meta-analysis. \n\nIt should be noted that the authors of neither study present their findings in a sensational form. Effect strengths and limitations of the studies are dutifully noted in the text. Nowhere do they argue that their findings should be considered in any regard as a categorical distinction between adherents of left-wing and right-wing attitudes. Clearly, the take-away message is that emotional and cognitive abilities are linked to traits that are associated with the right-wing political spectrum. But the studies do not allow any argument along the lines that a member of the right-wing spectrum has to be emotionally or cognitively deficient, whereas a member of the left-wing spectrum is bound to excel in emotional and cognitive tasks.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44952#44957", "answerId": "44957"}

Even varieties of meditation differ within themselves; according to one account, mindfulness meditation practices differ along 5 dimensions:\n\n\n  (1) intention and context of mindfulness practice, (2) bare attention, (3) attentional control, (4) wholesome emotions, and (5) ethical discernment\n\n\nThis leads to different effects depending on the style of meditation. Nonetheless, here are some of the findings:\n\nPsychological effects\n\nMeditation has been shown to be effective in self-regulation of many psychology factors including\n\n\n  present-moment pain, negative body image, inhibition of activity by pain, symptoms, mood disturbance, and psychological symptomatology, including anxiety and depression.\n\n\nTranscendental Meditation has been shown to be particularly effective in improving anxiety, though other forms of meditation also helped, to a lesser degree. \n\nAnother review concluded that:\n\n\n  Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions appear to be effective in the treatment of depression, anxiety, psychosis, borderline personality disorder and suicidal/self-harm behaviour.\n\n\nAlso, ACT therapy, a relatively new form of cognitive-behavioural therapy based on mindfulness, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a number of issues, including psychosis, anxiety, depression, pain management, quitting smoking, and substance abuse. A re-analysis showed that ACT was even more effective than some existing treatments.\n\nIn contrast, another meta-analysis concluded that the effect of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program on depression and anxiety is not reliable:\n\n\n  Evidence for a beneficial effect of MBSR on depression and anxiety was equivocal. When active control groups were used, MBSR did not show an effect on depression and anxiety. Adherence to the MBSR program was infrequently assessed. Where it was assessed, the relation between practising mindfulness and changes in depression and anxiety was equivocal. \n\n\nNeurological effects\n\nThis massive review summarises the research on neuroimaging studies of meditation and discusses the findings as they relate to psychological and clinical effects. The studies done to date show a number of changes to different areas of the brain, including frontal and prefrontal areas, which is linked with improvements to attention and information processing speed and efficiency. They conclude that effects on brain and nervous system function are undeniable, but due to differences in practice and research the exact nature of those effects requires more study.\n\nPhysiological effects\n\nThis review summarises some of the physiological effects linked directly to meditation (as opposed to those caused by e.g., simply resting), including changes to heart rate, blood flow, and metabolic processes.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/922#941", "answerId": "941"}

During REM periods our brains become as active as they are during waking, although not all parts of the brain are reactivated (the parts  of the brain that are reactivated in REM are discussed in Chapter 1 of Domhoff's The Scientific Study of Dreams (2003)).  REM periods vary in length from 5 to 10 minutes for the first REM period of the night to as long as 30-34 minutes later in the night. It thus seems likely that dreams can be a half hour or more in length.\n  \n  There is also evidence that we can dream in non-REM sleep in the hour or two before waking up, when the brain has become more activated than it was earlier in the night.  That's why we said that we dream \"at least\" 4 to 6 times per night.\n\n\nThey go on to qualify that there are also dreams while awake, REM periods without dreams, and evidence that children under 10 dream less frequently.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/32929#32940", "answerId": "32940"}

Therein, then New York chef Anthony Bourdain admitted that most fish suppliers in NYC are closed on Mondays thereby forcing restaurants to use older fish.  If you accept Mr. Bourdain's word, then I think that confirms the claim.  That book was written a decade ago, so I am not sure if that is still universally the case in NYC.\n\nThe Fulton Fish Market, which is the largest in New York (if not the USA), is currently closed on Saturdays and Sundays.  When they are open, however, the fish is very fresh:\n\n\n  Fish is flown and trucked in from locations all over the united states, and flown in from points all around the world.\n\n\nI can't find a citation supporting this, but I do know from some chef friends that fish from Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market is flown in to Fulton on a regular basis.  It is well known that Tsukiji's fish are very fresh, too:\n\n\n  Most of the fresh/live seafoods will be imported by the [sic] air freight to the Narita international airport or Kansai new international airport under the consignments sales agreement.Customs clearance at the airport will be done within 2-3 hours after the cargo arrival and immediately to truck to the Tsukiji fish market to sell...\n\n\nOne of the other huge independent suppliers of high-end seafood to the mid-Atlantic region of the US is Samuels &amp; Son.  Based in Philadelphia, they deliver to sushi restaurants from New York to Washington, DC, and are capable of delivering frozen, fresh, and even live seafood to almost anywhere in the mid-Atlantic within 24 hours, any day of the week.\n\nSpecifically related to sushi, however, one should note that many of the popular fish served in sushi restaurants, e.g., large fish like tuna, are delivered frozen and will therefore not be as affected by delivery dates.\n\nTherefore, it really depends on from where the sushi restaurant is procuring its fish.  But to answer your question, there are still suppliers who do not make deliveries on every day of the week.  However, there are some suppliers that make deliveries 24/7, so the claim is not by any means a hard and fast rule.\n\nAnecdotally, my local fishmonger (who is not located in NYC) admittedly is only able to receive deliveries of fresh fish every day except Wednesdays, so everything that is sold on Wednesdays is at least a day old.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6169#6171", "answerId": "6171"}

The claim doesn't tell us what wavelength this is, but lipids are hydrocarbons, so unless there is some other atom within these lipids then we are restricted to hydrogen, carbon and oxygen.\n\n2: A \"population inversion\" in the atoms of the lasing element. Its not just enough to shine a light on the medium; you have to get more than 50% of the atoms or molecules (depending on the medium used) into an \"excited state\" by getting them to absorb a photon. These photons are then re-emitted in step to produce the laser light. If you don't get 50% excited then more light will be absorbed than is emitted, and lasing won't happen.\n\n3: An \"optical cavity\", meaning in practice a mirror at either end.

It is known as the \"Blue-Seven Phenomena\", because when asked for a colour and a number from one to nine, these perform beyond expectation.\n\nThis 2015 encyclopedia entry surveys the research. One large sample of Japanese university students found:\n\n\n  As for the preferred number, the subjects in Saito\u2019s study selected \u201cseven\u201d most frequently (22.50 %), supporting Simon\u2019s [13] finding of the \u201cBlue-Seven Phenomenon.\u201d The reasons given for the choice showed that \u201cseven\u201d was associated with \u201clucky seven\u201d and was considered \u201ca lucky number\u201d and to \u201crepresent happiness\u201d among Japanese students. Other highly preferred numbers were found to be \u201cthree\u201d (16.24 %), \u201cfive\u201d (13.03 %), and \u201cone\u201d (11.84 %). Odd numbers accounted for 68.35 % of the responses. Male students selected the number \u201cone\u201d more often (men, 15.67 %; women, 9.07 %), the main reason given being that it represented \u201cnumber one\u201d or \u201ctop.\u201d Female students, on the other hand,\n  preferred \u201cfive\u201d (men, 9.66 %; women, 15.30 %), because they \u201cjust liked the number\u201d or because it was \u201ca birth date,\u201d \u201ca good cutoff point,\u201d or \u201ca shapely number.\u201d A gender difference was also found in number selection. Numbers were sometimes preferred for their \u201cvisual appearance.\u201d\n\n\nNow the original claim referred to numbers from one to one hundred, not just one to nine. I haven't found research on that broad a range, but changing the range of the numbers was examined in this 1977 paper titled The \"Blue Seven\" Is Not A Phenomenon. [The title of the paper doesn't  imply people don't pick blue and seven more frequently. It is that the people who pick blue aren't more likely to pick seven than the people who don't pick blue.]\n\nThey looked at the range 2-12 (to mimick dice games):\n\n\n  Changing the length of the range, and its beginning and end points, did\n  not affect the choice of seven in the preference condition\n\n\nThey also looked at the range 0-20:\n\n\n  A value of chi square for preferred number could not be calculated since\n  the expected frequency per cells was less than five. However, it is clear from\n  the frequency distribution that seven is not the preferred number. This result\n  holds for the favorite condition as well.

This work examines evidence of a cosmic ray cloud link from a\n  range of sources, including satellite-based cloud measurements and\n  long-term ground-based climatological measurements. The\n  satellite-based studies can be divided into two categories: (1)\n  monthly to decadal timescale analysis and (2) daily timescale\n  epoch-superpositional (composite) analysis. The latter analyses\n  frequently focus on sudden high-magnitude reductions in the cosmic ray\n  flux known as Forbush decrease events. At present, two long-term\n  independent global satellite cloud datasets are available (ISCCP and\n  MODIS). Although the differences between them are considerable,\n  neither shows evidence of a solar-cloud link at either long or short\n  timescales. Furthermore, reports of observed correlations between\n  solar activity and cloud over the 1983\u20131995 period are attributed to\n  the chance agreement between solar changes and artificially induced\n  cloud trends. It is possible that the satellite cloud datasets and\n  analysis methods may simply be too insensitive to detect a small solar\n  signal. Evidence from ground-based studies suggests that some weak but\n  statistically significant cosmic ray-cloud relationships may exist at\n  regional scales, involving mechanisms related to the global electric\n  circuit.

This is well known in rural enviorements, pigs is a clear example of this. The reason are stated in this study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United nations:\n\n\n  The energy required for muscle activity in the live animal is obtained\n  from sugars (glycogen) in the muscle. In the healthy and well-rested\n  animal, the glycogen content of the muscle is high. After the animal\n  has been slaughtered, the glycogen in the muscle is converted into\n  lactic acid, and the muscle and carcass becomes firm (rigor mortis).\n  This lactic acid is necessary to produce meat, which is tasteful and\n  tender, of good keeping quality and good colour. If the animal is\n  stressed before and during slaughter, the glycogen is used up, and the\n  lactic acid level that develops in the meat after slaughter is\n  reduced. This will have serious adverse effects on meat quality\n\n\nSpoilage of meat\n\n\n  It is necessary for animals to be stress and injury free during\n  operations prior to slaughter, so as not to unnecessarily deplete\n  muscle glycogen reserves. It is also important for animals to be well\n  rested during the 24-hour period before slaughter. This is in order to\n  allow for muscle glycogen to be replaced by the body as much as\n  possible (the exception being pigs, which should travel and be\n  slaughtered as stress free as possible but not rested for a prolonged\n  period prior to slaughter). It is important that the glycogen levels\n  in the muscles of the slaughtered carcass are as high as possible, to\n  develop the maximum level of lactic acid in the meat. This acid gives\n  meat an ideal pH level, measured after 24 hours after slaughter, of\n  6.2 or lower. The 24h (or ultimate) pH higher than 6.2 indicates that the animal was stressed, injured or diseased prior to slaughter.\n\n\nThis condition is called PSE (Pale, soft, exudative meat) which Wikipedia describes and explains it might be caused by stress prior to slaughter:\n\n\n  PSE meat, describes a carcass quality condition known to occur in both\n  pork and poultry. It is characterized by an abnormal color,\n  consistency, and water holding capacity, making the meat dry and\n  unattractive to consumers. The condition is believed to be caused by\n  abnormal muscle metabolism following slaughter, due to an altered rate\n  of glycolysis and a low pH within the muscle fibers. Genetic\n  predispositions and stress levels prior to slaughter are known to\n  affect the incidence of PSE meat.\n\n\nAlso it looks like there other  studies about this which conclude :\n\n\n  The results of recent scientific studies on pork quality should have a\n  great impact on the entire swine industry from the producer to the\n  packer to the consumer. The stress placed on pigs can be lessened with\n  the proper management practices, which increases meat quality and\n  benefits everyone\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19994#20008", "answerId": "20008"}

For example, in the section on Randomized Controlled Trials on Wheat, you say:\n\n\n  This advice resulted on a 22% death increase:\n  \n  However this result bordered on statistical significance: the 95% confidence interval being 0.99\u20131.65.\n  \n  Had the study last a little longer, it would have raised way more suspicion toward whole-grains.\n\n\nHowever the abstract of the linked study says:\n\n\n  Subjects given fibre advice had a slightly higher mortality than other subjects (not significant).\n\n\nWhen a result is not significant, it is not significant.  We can't use an insignificant result to make the claim that the \"advice resulted on a 22% death increase\".  We also can't say that it \"bordered on statistical significance\" without further evidence that it actually did.  We certainly can't predict the future outcome of a trial without actually conducting the trial.  If we could, we would be even have trials?\n\nA couple of paragraphs from Reflections on the Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART) illustrate some of the problems with trials of this sort that lead to insignificant data.  In the past, fibre has been seen as having a protective effect rather than the detrimental effect your article is claiming.\n\n\n  The relationship between fibre intake and mortality was paradoxical: within the group advised to eat more fibre there was an inverse relationship between fibre intake and mortality,yet its overall mortality was higher than that of the group not given this advice. There was a favourable effect of compliance with all three interventions, of\n  roughly equal size \u2014 a \u2018healthy complier effect\u2019 that was independent of the efficacy of the intervention. Good compliance seems to be a marker for something else, possibly a tendency to comply with other aspects of management that really do bestow benefit, or perhaps a better state of health: conceivably, people who feel unwell cannot be bothered to follow uncongenial diets. It is very difficult to allow adequately for such confounders.\n  \n  These findings illustrate the importance of the controlled trial as against observational studies. If the subjects advised to eat fibre are treated as a cohort, they appear to provide evidence of a protective effect of cereal fibre, an impression which the randomized trial shows to be misleading. Several cohort studies have shown an apparently favourable effect of cereal fibre on CHD[8\u201311], but confirmation by a randomized controlled trial is lacking.\n\n\n\n\nDirectly after your claim that the trial would have found statistically significant results if it had lasted longer, you make the claim:\n\n\n  In fact, researchers found this effect to be statistically significant in a follow-up study.\n\n\nHowever in the abstract of the linked study:\n\n\n  Fat and fibre advice had no clear effect on coronary or all-cause mortality.\n\n\nYou claim is contrary to the abstract of the paper.\n\nIt's worth noting that the fish results changed in the follow up paper as well.\n\n\n  The early reduction in all-cause mortality observed in those given fish advice (unadjusted hazard 0.70 (95% CI 0.54, 0.92)) was followed by an increased risk over the next 3 y (unadjusted hazard 1.31 (95% CI 1.01, 1.70).\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sentence, you state:\n\n\n  After adjusting for pre-existing conditions and medication use, we can see in the table 4 of this study an hazard ratio of 1.35 (95% CI 1.02, 1.80) for the 2-year period of the randomized controlled trial.\n\n\nThis is a case of cherry picking. You have chosen the highest number on the page, regardless of its relevance and failed to mention that in the same group in following years the ratio was reversed.  More people who were not given the advice died than those who were given it in some time periods.\n\nThe paper includes comments on this table:\n\n\n  All-cause mortality was increased in those given fibre advice in the first two time periods but reduced in the later time periods such that there was no long-term effect on survival. A similar pattern was present for coronary death. The risk of stroke death was slightly increased.\n\n\nWhile I haven't addressed every claim and every paper your article contains, the small part I did examine shows that your article does not do a good job of correctly reporting the results of the studies.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19092#19095", "answerId": "19095"}
{"question": "Do babies have their own language?", "questionId": "3072", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3072", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "There is not, as such, a baby language that we could understand or that other babies would understand.\n\nHowever there is a regularity in the way babies produce sounds as this is part of the process of aquiring language.\n\nNaturalistic studies of children's spontaneous speech (MacWhinney &amp; Snow, 1985, 1990; MacWhinney, 1991) have indicated that anguage acquisition begins very early in the human lifespan, and begins, logically enough, with the acquisition of a language's sound patterns. The main linguistic accomplishments during the first year of life are control of the speech musculature and sensitivity to the phonetic distinctions used in the parents' language. Interestingly, babies achieve these feats before they produce or understand words, so their learning cannot depend on correlating sound with meaning. That is, they cannot be listening for the difference in sound between a word they think means bit and a word they think means beet, because they have learned neither word. They must be sorting the sounds directly, somehow tuning their speech analysis module to deliver the phonemes used in their language (Kuhl, et al., 1992). The module can then serve as the front end of the system that learns words and grammar.\n\nShortly before their first birthday, babies begin to understand words, and around that birthday, they start to produce them (see Clark, 1993; Ingram, 1989). Words are usually produced in isolation; this one-word stage can last from two months to a year. Children's first words are similar all over the planet. About half the words are for objects: food (juice, cookie, body parts (eye, nose), clothing (diaper, sock), vehicles (car, boat), toys (doll, block), household items (bottle, light, animals (dog, kitty), and people (dada, baby). There are words for actions, motions, and routines, like (up, off, open, peekaboo, eat, and go, and modifiers, like hot, allgone, more, dirty, and cold. Finally, there are routines used in social interaction, like yes, no, want, bye-bye, and hi -- a few of which, like look at that and what is that, are words in the sense of memorized chunks, though they are not single words for the adult. Children differ in how much they name objects or engage in social interaction using memorized routines, though all children do both.\n\nAround 18 months, language changes in two ways. Vocabulary growth increases; the child begins to learn words at a rate of one every two waking hours, and will keep learning that rate or faster through adolescence (Clark, 1993; Pinker, 1994). And primitive syntax begins, with two-word strings like the following:\n\n All dry.            All messy.          All wet.\n I sit.              I shut.             No bed.\n No pee.             See baby.           See pretty.\n More cereal.        More hot.           Hi Calico.\n Other pocket.       Boot off.           Siren by.\n Mail come.          Airplane allgone.   Bybebye car.\n Our car.            Papa away.          Dry pants.\n\n\nOur car. Papa away. Dry pants. Children's two-word combinations are highly similar across cultures. Everywhere, children announce when objects appear, disappear, and move about, point out their properties and owners, comment on people doing things and seeing things, reject and request objects and activities, and ask about who, what, and where. These sequences already reflect the language being acquired: in 95% of them, the words are properly ordered (Braine, 1976; Brown, 1973; Pinker, 1984; Ingram, 1989).\nEven before they put words together, babies can comprehend a sentence using its syntax. For example, in one experiment, babies who spoke only in single words were seated in front of two television screens, each of which featured a pair of adults dressed up as Cookie Monster and Big Bird from Sesame Street. One screen showed Cookie Monster tickling Big Bird; the other showed Big Bird tickling Cookie Monster. A voice-over said, \"OH LOOK!!! BIG BIRD IS TICKLING COOKIE MONSTER!! FIND BIG BIRD TICKLING COOKIE MONSTER!!\" (Or vice-versa.) The children must have understood the meaning of the ordering of subject, verb, and object, because they looked more at the screen that depicted the sentence in the voice-over (Hirsh-Pasek &amp; Golinkoff, 1991).\n\nBut the random noises that babies make are only structured in so much as the child is striving to imitate sounds it hears adults make.\n\nInterestingly enough whilst looking into this I found some anthropological research that suggested that \"babytalk\" as spoken by adults to babies contains some universal elements common across cultures.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3072#4717", "answerId": "4717"}

Both epidemiologic\n  and controlled animal and human experiments suggest that boron\n  supplementation in amounts found in some diets throughout the world is\n  effective in preventing or treating various forms of arthritis.\n\n\n3) A small study about the effectiveness of boron in reliving symptoms of osteoarthritis: Boron and Arthritis: The Results of a Double-blind Pilot Study (Tandofline, 2009, a study from 1990):\n\n\n  This report describes the conduct and results of a double-blind trial\n  comparing oral intake of 6 mg of boron per day to placebo in the\n  treatment of arthritis. The results indicate that boron may well be\n  beneficial. Of the 10 patients on boron, five improved and five did\n  not, but only one of the 10 patients on the placebo improved...There\n  were no side-effects and these were sought.

The pictures are meant to be illustrative; criticising the second picture for e.g. giving the \"wrong\" year is attacking a straw man.\n\n(For completeness, I am addressing your questions about the picture at the end of this answer, anyway.)\n\n\n\n\n  It would be interesting to know if the average weight of polar bears has reduced in the last 10 years\n\n\nYes.\n\nFrom Wikipedia: Polar bears # Climate change, emphasis mine:\n\n\n  The effects of climate change are most profound in the southern part of the polar bear's range, and this is indeed where significant degradation of local populations has been observed.[182] The Western Hudson Bay subpopulation, in a southern part of the range, also happens to be one of the best-studied polar bear subpopulations. [...]\n  \n  Due to warming air temperatures, ice-floe breakup in western Hudson Bay is currently occurring three weeks earlier than it did 30 years ago, reducing the duration of the polar bear feeding season.[163] The body condition of polar bears has declined during this period; the average weight of lone (and likely pregnant) female polar bears was approximately 290 kg (640 lb) in 1980 and 230 kg (510 lb) in 2004.[163]\n\n\nSource [182] is:\n\n\nArctic Climate Impact Assessment (2004). Impact of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Impact Climate Assessment: Key Finding 4. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-61778-9. OCLC 56942125..\n\n\nSource [163] is:\n\n\nStirling, Ian; Derocher, Andrew E. (2007). \"Melting under pressure: The real scoop on climate warming and polar bears\" (PDF). The Wildlife Professional (published Fall 2007). 1 (3): 24\u201327, 43.\n\n\nI don't think there is reason to believe that this is offset by an increase of 20% in body weight in other regions (lacking any plausible increase in living conditions).\n\n\n\nAs for your questions about the image in particular:\n\n\n  2019 has only just begun. It seems a little unlikely that the image of the polar bear was taken in the last 15 days (but not impossible, of course)\n\n\nIt was not taken 2019, but in 2015. The idea of the \"2019\" / \"2009\" given in the picture is not, however, to claim that those were the years in which the pictures were taken. As stated in the FB post (\"The 10 years challenge we should really care about...\"), the idea was to illustrate the worsening situation of polar bears (and probably climate change in general), *in context of the \"10 year challenge\". The \"2019\" is today, the \"better\" 2009 (to illustrate that the situation is worsening) is just \"10 years back from right now\".\n\n\n  The second polar bear appears to have just emerged from water (drops coming from its tail?). This can often cause fur to clump (it happens to my dog when he is bathed). Is this causing a lot of the difference?\n\n\nAn image search for \"wet polar bear\" shows a wide range of results, with the specimen pictured under \"2019\" definitely being on the emaciated side. Yes, wet fur makes a difference -- but not that much.\n\n\n  Were the images taken at different times of year? I believe that polar bears hibernate. It could be that the first polar bear has been eating, storing up fat for the winter period, and the second has just left hibernation.\n\n\nPolar bears are not true hibernators. But even a healthy female bear just out of \"hibernation\", being wet does not look like the specimen in the \"2019\" picture.\n\n\n  Is the image of the same polar bear? I\u2019m fairly confident it isn\u2019t - hence I\u2019ve taken it to be a comparison of the typical bear then and now.\n\n\nIt's nowhere claimed that it's the same bear. The life expectancy of a wild polar bear rarely exceeds 20 years.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/43222#43224", "answerId": "43224"}
{"question": "Does black seed oil help treat various cancers, asthma, epilepsy, liver conditions, high blood pressure and more?", "questionId": "5287", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5287", "category": "medical-science", "categoryId": 2, "answer": "There are some kernels of legitimate facts in here, however, upon reading further, it becomes quite clear that they are not understood properly by the author.\n\nThe scant amount of real facts can be hard to discern from this site mainly because the author's inability to interpret scientific evidence is surpassed only by her inability to form a coherent (and spell-checked) argument. For this degree of scholarship to be made widely available, I say, thank you, internet....\n\nHowever it was not so much her misrepresentation of the research (either deliberate or unintentional) which bothered me as much as the truly reprehensible way in which she words her article so as to allow the reader to draw his/her own fantastic conclusions by implication while at the same time DELIBERATELY NEVER MAKING A SINGLE CLAIM ABOUT THE PRODUCT ITSELF, so as to avoid giving those of a dissenting viewpoint any easy ground to stand on. \n\nHowever she does leave enough blatant errors to more than make up for it.\n\nI'll apologize, because I'll undoubtedly spend more time picking apart her atrocious rhetoric and pointing out egregious errors than providing the simple facts regarding what's currently understood about the main ingredient mentioned in the article.  So, scroll down until you see FINALLY! THE FACTS if you want the quick answer.\n\notherwise, enjoy the rant... \n\nThe only way I can think to do this properly is to take the site point by point.  So here goes. \n\n\n  Black cumin oil is safe enough to use as a household remedy for almost\n  every ailment from stomach ache, insect stings, allergies, colds, flu,\n  bruises, hair loss, lethargy etc.. This wonder herb is also powerful\n  enough to be used at a Practitioners level with astounding\n  versatility. It is used for serious diseases such as asthma, diabetes,\n  colon cleanse, candida, immune system disorders, hepatitis, AIDS and\n  even cancer.\n\n\nThis Gish gallop of disparate, fantastic, and completely unverified claims comes right from the top of the site, and of course is an immediate skeptical red flag.The author certainly has heaped on the reader quite the list of claims to investigate, lest the reader be chided for dismissing them a priori.\n\n(And of course the colon cleanse fails by all criteria to qualify as a serious disorder.  It is only a symptom of a much more serious disorder: an unfounded belief in pseudoscience.)  \n\nBut, fortunately for us the site has not yet made a single claim about the product or its effectiveness for us to disprove....\n\n\n  \"safe enough to use as a household remedy\"\n\n\nwhile sounding impressive enough to allow the reader to draw his/her own conclusions does not indicate effectiveness.\n\n\n  \"powerful enough to use at a Practitioner's level\".\n\n\nFirst, practitioner of what?  Not specified.  Second, there is no claim made regarding either efficacy or safety.\n\n\n  \"Used for serious diseases\".\n\n\nAgain, used by whom?  And again there is no claim to effectiveness. or safety.  \n\nMoving on, the introduction to this site has said absolutely nothing about the product while encouraging the reader to think very much of it.\nNext...\n\n\n  Around 1325 B.C., the Pharaoh Tutankhamen's servants entombed him with\n  the precious artifacts he would require in the afterlife. Black seed\n  was found among the selected items, proving that this spice's value\n  extends back to ancient times. Roman, Greek and Arab cultures utilized\n  it as an herbal remedy and a culinary ingredient. Today, medical\n  researchers hypothesize that black seed may have antioxidant,\n  anti-cancer and cardioprotective properties, according to professor of\n  cancer research, Bharat Aggarwal, author of \"Healing Spices.\"\n\n\nFirst, the author uses \"the argument from antiquity\" surreptitiously by allusion in order to suggest that the possibility of ancient knowledge of the compound somehow validates any of the things hinted at in the introduction.  But those were not intended to be actual claims anyway, just to sound like them. \n\nI would also contend that the author attempts the worst celebrity endorsement ever; by proposing a link to the world's most famous mummy, King Tut. Although this factoid is not unique to the author, I have run across it in other places. It seems to originate from some interpretation of the information contained in Domestication of Plants in the Old World: The Origin and Spread of Cultivated Plants in West Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley but the $150.00 price tag and limited availability makes this a hard source to check.I would be interested to know. \n\nHowever, a complete archive of items found in the tomb is kept by the Griffith Institute and can be found and searched here.\n\nThe search function failed to yield confirmation, so I looked through the archive item by item ( I had a little time) and this is the best I could find: (5) Small seed of (?): not corn\n\nAnd of course since the ancient Egyptians clearly had deeper and more profound understanding of medicine than scientists today, as they also included nearly 50 boxes of prepared food (repeatedly proven essential for the growing boy mummy) and a few chariot wheels.  \n\nSo, not only does that statement seem to be questionable, but at best it would convey only that the Egyptians seemed to view the black seed as being of equal medicinal value to the chariot wheel, and possibly less so, as there is documented presence of more than one chariot wheel, but only one seed..\n\nBharat Aggarwal is a published, noted, and quite legitimate researcher at the University of Texas, although he seems to have an oddly narrow (but seemingly valid) area of focus.  \n\n\n  His group has identified over 50 compounds from dietary sources and\n  traditional medicine that interrupt these cell-signaling pathways;\n  have been tested in various animal models and some are in clinical\n  trials source\n\n\nHis name appears mainly to be listed here as an appeal to authority, and his book \"Healing Spices\" seems to be slightly more academically rigorous and based in cited research than some others of its ilk, I would call it at best controversial from what I've managed to find of it, as it seems to contain some leaps of logic from preliminary research straight to dietary advice.\n\n\n  Black seed comes from the Nigella sativa plant, which is native to the\n  Mediterranean region, and now grows the Middle East and India as well.\n  An annual herb, it blooms with fragile, pale blue flowers. It is often\n  confused with several other black seed spices. Black seed, Nigella\n  sativa, is commonly known as charnushka in the United States or\n  kalonji in India. Black cumin, Buniun persicum, for example, is an\n  altogether different spice, according to Aggarwal.\n\n\nHowever, again she mentions his findings with regard to black seed in a manner that will allow the average reader to draw his/her own conclusions regarding the effect black seed can have on cancer, which as I'll show later is promising, but still very preliminary. \n\nBut my absolute favorite implosion of logic so far comes from this very statement:\n\n\n  Black cumin, Buniun persicum, for example, is an altogether different\n  spice, according to Aggarwal.\n\n\nHUH?\n\nBut wait, if Black Seed is not the same as Black Cumin, what did we read at the top of the page?\n\n\n\nWhich is it, you're talking about?  Black seed? which looks like:\n\n\n\nor black cumin?  \n\n\n\nThis legitimately reeks of someone who has not thoroughly researched the topic about which she chooses to promote.  And the best part is, her inconsistency is pointed out in the the quote from the expert she chose to cite!  It couldn't possibly get better!\n\nAh, but it does. \n\nDo a quick google search for the the word \"Buniun persicum\".  You'll get this:\n\n\n\nand for fun, an image search for the incorrect spelling gives us:\n\n.  \n\nWhy, it's none other than the author of the site used in the question, what are the odds? \n\nOf course, this indicates that the misspelling is localized, if not unique to her, and article cited in the original question.  So, not only did the author quote an expert who ended serving no purpose other than calling attention to the fact that her claims not only aren't valid, but aren't even claims, but she then goes on to misspell an essential term.  \n\n\n  One of black seed's primary bioactive components is thymolquinone, or\n  TQ, which is found in its essential oil. So far, notes Aggarwal,\n  botanists have established black seed as the only source of TQ.\n  Scientific evidence shows that TQ can protect cells from oxidative\n  damage. Additionally, TQ demonstrated anti-inflammatory action in the\n  laboratory, according to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,\n  MSKCC. Other constituents of black seed exhibited antihistamine,\n  diuretic and antispasmodic properties. MSKCC also explains that black\n  seed may be utilized for other conditions, such as asthma, epilepsy,\n  liver protection and high blood pressure. Seek advice from a health\n  practitioner before ...sing black seed medicinally\n\n\nFINALLY! THE FACTS!\n\n\nDoes TQ have anti-inflammatory effects?\n\nPossibly.  Or something similar. At least in mice. According to one study which indicates it may be potentially useful to study for its antinociceptive (painkilling) effects.\n\n\n\n  The antinociceptive effect of morphine was significantly reduced in\n  thymoquinone- and N. sativa oil-tolerant mice, but not vice versa.\n  These results suggest that N. sativa oil and thymoquinone produce\n  antinociceptive effects through indirect activation of the supraspinal\n  mu(1)- and kappa-opioid receptor subtypes. source\n\n\n\nDo other constituents of black seed exhibit antihistamine, diuretic\nand antispasmodic properties?\n\n\nAs long as those \"other constituents\" remain unnamed I won't dignify this nonsense with a response.  This is akin to saying that \"other constituents\" of a slice of bread (approx 42% water as a conservative estimate, but can be more depending on the type of bread and preferences of the baker) will cure dehydration.\n\n\nDoes TQ treat asthma?\n\nAgain.  Possibly.  In mice.  But only if the same anti-inflammatory processes noted above are actually sound, this appears to be only the very earliest preliminary extrapolation of the effects it could have.\n\n\n\n  Administration of TQ before OVA challenge inhibited 5-lipoxygenase,\n  the main enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis, expression by lung cells\n  and significantly reduced the levels of LTB4 and LTC4. This was\n  accompanied by a marked decrease in Th2 cytokines and BAL fluid and\n  lung tissue eosinophilia, all of which are characteristics of airway\n  inflammation. These results demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effect\n  of TQ in experimental asthma source\n\n\nso, there is potential for TQ to operate on the immunologic response which mediates inflammation and asthma.  At least in animal models.\n\n\nDoes TQ Exhibit antihistamine properties?\n\n\nCurrently being studied here, most likely because it is logical that something which has an effect on the inflammatory asthmatic process may have an effect on the allergic process, as they are similar in some ways.\n\n\nDoes TQ exhibit anticonvulsive effects?\n\n\nA pilot study done on 22 subjects\n\n\n  RESULTS: the reduction of frequency of seizures at the end of first\n  period in comparison with the same period before the study\n  demonstrated a significant difference between two groups (thymoquinone\n  and placebo) (P=0.04). Also reduction of frequency of seizure has\n  shown significant difference between two groups at the end of second\n  period in comparison with end of first period (P=0.02). The parental\n  satisfaction showed significant difference between the two groups at\n  the end of the first period (P=0.03).\n  \n  CONCLUSION: it can be concluded that thymoquinone has anti-epileptic\n  effects in children with refractory seizures.  source\n\n\nThis may seem to clearly indicate promise, until one remembers that this is only a pilot study and involved only a group of 22.\n\nI'm skipping the \"liver protection\" inference, because it is not a testable claim.  Protection from what?\n\n\nDoes TQ help to treat diabetes?\n\n\nSigh.  Again.  Possibly.  In rats.\n\n\n  Our data demonstrated a significant decrease in the numbers of\n  neonates born to diabetic rats compared with those born to control\n  rats. GD led to macrosomic pups with several postpartum complications,\n  such as a significant increase in plasma levels of the\n  pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 (but not of IL-10);\n  a marked decrease in the plasma level of IL-2; a marked reduction in\n  the proliferative capacity of superantigen (SEB)-stimulated\n  T-lymphocytes; and an obvious reduction in the number of circulating\n  and thymus homing T cells. TQ supplementation of diabetic mothers\n  during pregnancy and lactation periods had an obvious and significant\n  effect on the number and mean body weight of neonates. Furthermore, TQ\n  significantly restored the IL-2 level and T cell proliferation and\n  subsequently rescued both circulating and thymus homing T cells in the\n  offspring.\n  \n  CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that nutritional supplementation of GD\n  mothers with the natural antioxidant TQ during pregnancy and lactation\n  periods improves diabetic complications and maintains an efficient T\n  cell immune response in their offspring, providing a protective effect\n  in later life. source\n\n\n\nRegarding cancer\n\n\nSome preliminary study indicates a possibility for potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in the future, for brain tumors:\n\n\n  Our results indicate that thymoquinone induces DNA damage, telomere\n  attrition by inhibiting telomerase and cell death in glioblastoma\n  cells. Telomere shortening was found to be dependent on the status of\n  DNA-PKcs. Collectively, these data suggest that thymoquinone could be\n  useful as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the management for\n  brain tumours. source\n\n\nConcluding...\n\nWhile the substance may have some potential in treating specific tumors in the future, this in no way should be taken to imply that it is effective against \"cancer\" or any of the other conditions mentioned, at least not yet, and probably not for many years.  \n\nAlso, it certainly does not imply that a natural basis for a chemotherapeutic cancer drug is that unusual, and of course to assume that whatever comes of this research would be somehow safer or better than currently used treatment modalities would be to commit the naturalistic fallacy. \n\nIn the end, black seed oil may become an interesting avenue for future research, mainly due to its potential anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic properties.  \n\nAt the very least the evidence we currently have indicates it may at the very least be beneficial for rats.\n\nBut it's far too early to make any claims as to the medicinal value of compounds extracted from black seed oil and is ludicrous to think that dietary consumption of it will have the same or even similar effects.  \n\nThis seems to be another case of the journalism getting way ahead of the science, and in this case, it seems to have been delivered very poorly.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5287#5308", "answerId": "5308"}

That information is well established. It was actually published by the Mayo Clinic, that gluten can in fact be related to risk for dementia. So I would beg to differ with you on that point. Gluten, certainly in patients with celiac  disease, is strongly associated with risk for dementia. As was described in the proceedings of the Mayo Clinic, it was a treatable cause of dementia.

It shows an unconscious monkey about to be decapitated, and then a photo of the brains, clearly from the same meal:\n\n\n\nHowever, there is a crucial thing missing here: the monkey was \"alive\" (all meat is alive before it is killed...) but it was knocked out and was never eaten alive; the patrons did not scoop the brains out of a screaming monkey, which is how the gruesome legend usually goes.\n\nThe translator of the article reports that he had never once heard of a town where monkey brains could actually be eaten from a living, breathing monkey. He had often heard of this as a second-hand rumor, and occasionally as something experienced in childhood, but there was never a specific village or town named where the practice existed. He therefore dubbed this a myth made up to scare urbanites. Locals will tell urbanites, \"it's a very backwards place, they eat live monkey brains over there,\" and then gleefully repeat the macabre myth, but it's very rare for anyone to ever say they had some for themselves. (When I was in Japan, I was personally told that there was a live monkey brain restaurant in the back streets of Fukuoka -- invitation-only, of course. Someone had modified the common rumor to make it local.) The Apple Daily story even says that they had the story told to them with an apology that the practice no longer exists. In a part of the world with many unusual foods, such a rumor apparently can apply to anywhere remote enough and has entertainment value.\n\nI agree with the translator that the specific question asked about \"traditional cuisine\" can be answered with a firm \"no\". Monkeys are sometimes available for purchase at the market in southwest China, Vietnam and Malaysia, and I suppose it's not out of the question that a monkey could be beaten into submission and eaten live, but live monkey brains have never been \"on the menu\" as local cuisine and no one has ever been able to point to a specific location where they can be eaten.\n\nThe major roadblock to such \"traditional cuisine\" comes up in Apple Daily's follow-up story in 2001. They returned to the monkey brain village and wrote that the practice was still ongoing. But they also reported that monkeys at the bazaar knew the fate that awaited them and did not take it sitting down. I believe this poses the biggest problem to eating live monkey brains: it will not be a pleasant experience if the monkey fails to cooperate.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20660#23423", "answerId": "23423"}

Why has it become so widely accepted?\n\n\n\n(But seriously, they were scientists and used beepy flashy things to detect ghosts)\n\n\n\nThis 2005 article states that EMF meters have been used for \"ghost hunting\" for decades:\n\n\n  [A] major stimulus of today's tech-heavy ghost-hunting trend happened in 1984: The film \"Ghostbusters\" was released.\n  \n  ...No one really knows what kind of influence a ghost might have on the environment, so ghost hunters try anything and everything.\n  \n  \"If we're doing a full-scale investigation, it goes from the simple electromagnetic-field meters\" -- handheld devices that have been ubiquitous on ghost expeditions since the early 1990s -- \"all the way to digital video recorder systems with between eight and 12 cameras, depending on the size of the place,\" said Gloria Young, founder of the Santa Clara group Ghost Trackers. Young also uses a Geiger counter, which measures radiation; motion detectors; barometric pressure monitors; and thermometers.\n\n\nIt goes on to quote a quotes a prominent ghost hunter:\n\n\n  Ghost hunting has grown in the past two decades from a little-known hobby to a much more popular pursuit. Ghost hunters say that, judging from the number of ghost-hunting organizations with Web sites, there are hundreds of groups with thousands of members in the United States.\n  \n  And technology is a major force behind the trend, said Loyd Auerbach, director and founder of the Office of Paranormal Investigations in the East Bay.\n  \n  \"It was the late 1980s when things began to expand, and part of it was the availability of certain types of technology that we started using in the field,\" like electromagnetic-field detectors, which start at around $100, Auerbach said. \"Part of it was seeing people like me on TV.\"\n\n\nThere has probably been a recent rise in popularity of EMF meters being used to detect ghosts that tracks the rise in popularity of shows like \"Ghost Hunters\" where they use the device, among others, to \"detect ghosts\". Because if you use scientific equipment, you must be doing science, right?\n\n\n  The two featured investigators, Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, are proudly blue-collar workers, not egghead Ph.D. scientists, which adds to their strong \"regular guy\" appeal.\n  ...They claim to be skeptics but are very credulous and seem to have no real understanding of scientific methods or real investigation.\n\n\nBut if you're on TV, you have to appear legitimate. From the original cited article:\n\n\n  \"If you take the human factor out and just have this instrument, it (seems to) confer some legitimacy -- which these folks desperately want,\" \n\n\nMore recently, all-in-one \"ghost detector\" devices have been released, which I presume are riding the coattails of popular shows such as these.\n\n\n\nIs there a scientific reason to think that an anomalous electromagnetic field has anything to do with the supernatural?\n\nNo, and ghost hunters themselves cannot cite a single possible theory that EM fields are related to the supernatural. This Live Science article quotes a prominent ghost hunter:\n\n\n  An EMF meter is among the most common devices used by ghost hunters today. I spoke to Tom Cook, of TomsGadgets.com, a British purveyor of \"scientific\" paranormal kits for the enterprising (and gullible) investigator. Starter kits begin at \u00a3105 (US$180) and reach up to \u00a3500 (US$850) for a custom ghost-hunting kit. (Negative Ionizer Ghost Containment packs were not listed.)\n  \n  I asked Cook what, exactly, the scientific rationale was behind the equipment he sold.\n  \n  \"At a haunted location,\" Cook said, \"strong, erratic fluctuating EMFs are commonly found. It seems these energy fields have some definite connection to the presence of ghosts. The exact nature of that connection is still a mystery. However, the anomalous fields are easy to find. Whenever you locate one, a ghost might be present.... any erratic EMF fluctuations you may detect may indicate ghostly activity.\"\n  \n  In the final analysis, Cook admitted, \"there exists no device that can conclusively detect ghosts.\"\n\n\nFrom the Wikipedia page on Ghost Hunting:\n\n\n  EMF meter: to detect possibly unexplained fluctuations in electromagnetic fields.\n\n\nUnfortunately in addition to being vague, that line does not cite any sources. So, if one believes (without basis) that ghosts somehow cause \"unexplained\" fluctuations in electromagnetic fields, the EMF meter would be a valid piece of equipment for hunting ghosts.\n\nConsidering the other methods and equipment listed there include dowsing rods, ghost boxes, psychics, clairvoyants and demonologists, it's unlikely that any ghost hunters have commissioned scientific studies into why background EMF levels would fluctuate without an explainable cause.\n\nBut really, to a ghost hunter (or TV watcher) an EMF meter is a beeping, flashing device that can \"go off\" seemingly randomly (though why that might occur is a separate question), which makes things exciting.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3050#3053", "answerId": "3053"}
{"question": "Does ghee help burn body fat?", "questionId": "27795", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27795", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "The short version is that it might have an effect, but there is no evidence to date.\n\nI was surprised to find that there are actually quite a few scientific studies on this subject. There's an even larger literature on the effects in animals than in humans. \n\nA good survey paper on the area (which may be paywalled) is found here. The crux of it is that the best designed studies to date do not find any significant difference in fatty mass changes between those who take quite large doses of CLA (roughly equal to eating 250ml of ghee a day, if my understanding of ghee's CLA composition is correct), and those who just eat an olive oil capsule instead. This holds across many populations. Experienced weightlifters, novice weightlifters, and overweight or obese persons. The only human studies reporting significant effects tracked changes over a quite short period of time, or else had systematic problems.\n\nAn example of a study that has some problems can be found here.\n\nThe study above shows a decrease in fatty mass for overweight and obese individuals who consumed concentrated CLA (roughly equal to the amount found in about a half a litre of Ghee, from what I can ascertain) in daily doses, versus those who consumed an equal amount of olive oil (the control). \n\nThe improvement is statistically significant, but extremely small. Over 12 weeks, the average subject on olive oil gained about 1.5kg (~3lb) of fat, while those taking CLA lost a small amount of fat instead, but also gained about 1.5kg of lean mass.\n\nEven if the study did control properly for exercise, they found no benefit beyond a dose of about 3.5 grams/day of CLA. A weighloss supplement that cuts ~1/4 pound per week from an overweight person is not particularly impressive. The person could just as easily drink one less glass of soda (or milk!) per day to lose at the same rate.\n\nHowever, the study included sending an offer of training from a local gym to all participants. Those in the higher CLA dosage groups were found to have engaged in an average of 1 more hour of \"heavy training\" per week by the end of the study than at the start. Over a 12 week period, that could easily be enough to result in a recomposition of just 2kg or so (i.e. trading 2kg of fat for muscle), especially in novices engaged in something like resistance training. The changes in BMI between the groups were not significant at the end of the study, suggesting that all participants gained the same weight, just some of them put it on as muscle.\n\nSo, to sum up, there do not seem to be any reputable studies showing a benefit in body fat loss from consuming CLA. There seems to be a lot of interest in it because it is present in certain health foods (like Ghee) though.\n\nAs an aside, I'm personally very sceptical of claims that any food (especially what is essentially liquefied fat!) will magically cause weightloss or fat loss. Losing weight isn't complicated. To get rid of a few pounds of \"stubborn\" fat, eat fewer calories than you burn (your TDEE) and exercise more for a few weeks. As a general rule, all the rest of it is noise or tiny effects not worth worrying about. Remember: if there was a miracle cure for weightloss, everyone would be thin already. Companies would be lining up to sell it.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27795#27839", "answerId": "27839"}

Since then, new information is available which provides a better answer.  I have up voted DavePhD's answer and hope others will as well.\n\nORIGINAL: At this point, the only accurate answer is that we don't know for sure.  This study indicates that Antarctic ice is increasing overall, while many other studies indicate that it is decreasing.  This study used data only from 1992 to 2008, while other papers using more recent have reached the opposite conclusion.  Even this study indicates that the rate of ice gain is slowing, and will become a net loss in the future. \n\nRobert McSweeny has written a good summary of the recent article, with some comparisons to other studies.  The study was done using satellite-based lasers to measure ice thickness over different regions in Antarctica, from 1992 to 2008.  The study found that the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) both lost ice during that time, and the East Arctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) accumulated on average about 1 cm of ice.  Overall, the study found that there was a net increase of ice.\n\n\n  The study concludes that the gains in ice over East Antarctica outweigh the losses on WAIS and the peninsula between 1992 and 2008.\n\n\nAccording to the study, Antarctica has been gaining ice for about 10,000 years:\n\n\n  So, where is this extra ice on East Antarctica coming from? The researchers say it all started around 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age. As the air warmed up, it could hold more moisture, and the amount of snow that fell onto the ice sheet doubled. Since then, this extra snow has gradually been compacting into ice, making the ice sheet thicker.\n\n\nBut the study also measured a reduction the overall Antarctic ice gain, i.e. ice losses in other parts of Antarctica are catching up with ice gains in the EAIS:\n\n\n  But the gap between ice gained and ice lost is getting smaller. Between 1992 and 2001, the net gain was 112bn tonnes a year, the paper finds. This dropped to 82bn tonnes between 2003 and 2008. \n\n\nSeveral other studies have measured net ice losses in the EIAS in years more recent than were included in this study, for example:\n\n\n  Some of the more recent studies use the CryoSat-2 satellite, which was launched in 2010. A paper published in July analysed the first three years of this data, and finds that between 2010 and 2013, West Antarctica, East Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula lost 134bn, 3bn, and 23bn tonnes of ice per year, respectively.\n\n\nIn summary, this is one of many studies on the subject, and more work will be needed to fully answer the question.  It does not, however, contradict any of the key findings of climate science.\n\n\n  It will take a number of other studies, both satellite and on-the-ground research, to confirm if the new NASA study is correct about East Antarctica. If it is confirmed, it will still only apply up to 2008, not to the present day.\n\n\nAs Prof. Richard Alley states:\n\n\n  What is absolutely obvious is that this does not in any way mean that we don\u2019t need to worry about sea level rise from our warming.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/30757#30758", "answerId": "30758"}

There is no generally available means of protection against the injurious effect of\n  radiation. The results of this and previous studies show that all the so-called protective\n  devices, such as sun glasses, filters, smoked or stained glass, or old negatives do not give\n  effective protection and may even facilitate injury by prolonging the time of exposure. \n\n\n\n\nFor a second opinion, this paper (from NASA's web site) claims that you need a filter which attenuates visible and infrared light:\n\nObserving the Eclipse\nEye Safety And Solar Eclipses\nB. Ralph Chou, MSc, OD\nAssociate Professor, School of Optometry, University of Waterloo\n\n\n  Exposure of the retina to intense visible light causes damage to its light-sensitive rod and cone cells. The light triggers a series of complex chemical reactions within the cells which damages their ability to respond to a visual stimulus, and in extreme cases, can destroy them. The result is a loss of visual function which may be either temporary or permanent, depending on the severity of the damage. When a person looks repeatedly or for a long time at the Sun without proper protection for the eyes, this photochemical retinal damage may be accompanied by a thermal injury - the high level of visible and near-infrared radiation causes heating that literally cooks the exposed tissue. This thermal injury or photocoagulation destroys the rods and cones, creating a small blind area. The danger to vision is significant because photic retinal injuries occur without any feeling of pain (there are no pain receptors in the retina), and the visual effects do not occur for at least several hours after the damage is done [Pitts, 1993].\n  \n  The Sun can only be viewed directly when filters specially designed to protect the eyes are used. Most such filters have a thin layer of chromium alloy or aluminum deposited on their surfaces that attenuates both visible and near-infrared radiation. A safe solar filter should transmit less than 0.0003% (density~4.5)10 of visible light (380 to 780 nm) and no more than 0.5% (density~2.3) of the near-infrared radiation (780 to 1400 nm). Figure 24 shows the spectral response for a selection of safe solar filters.\n  \n  One of the most widely available filters for safe solar viewing is shade number 14 welder's glass, which can be obtained from welding supply outlets.

Since the cat is\n  falling only a short distance at a\n  fairly low velocity, it is safe to\n  assume that the only force acting on\n  the cat is gravity. Thus,\n  \n  ma = -mg,\n  \n  where m is the mass of the cat, a is\n  the acceleration of the cat, and -mg\n  is the force of gravity (assuming up\n  is positive), where g is a constant (g\n  = 979 cm/sec2 at a latitude like San Diego when you add centripetal\n  acceleration to the standard value\n  given for g, which is 980.7 cm/sec2 ).\n  \n   See: Differential Equations and\n  Integration for all the fun math. \n\n\nThe maximum height and velocity are related.

I've seen this idea bandied about personal finance blogs and forums before, and always thought it was a bit nutty, since, as noted in the comments to this question, paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first will minimize both total payments and time until you are debt free. Despite this, it is a notable claim, and one that is widely repeated (at least in my experience).\n\nIt turns out this strategy has been studied very recently by the US \"National Bureau of Economic Research\" (NBER), which appears to be a think-tank devoted to economic policy issues. They claim to be \"non-partisan\", though I have no way of verifying this.\n\nThe introduction of their working paper (page 1) provides a good synopsis of the claim and reasons why it might be true. The claim was popularized by radio host Dave Ramsey.\n\nThis paper also cites a 2012 analysis of data gathered from a debt collections agency, which showed that the snowball method was actually an extremely effective strategy for people in arrears. The number of accounts closed so far turns out to be a strong predictor of closing more accounts, regardless of the dollar amounts on the individual accounts. The dollar amounts paid off so far, in contrast, were not predictive. \n\nThe 2012 study already answers the question empirically (yes, at least for people sent to collections agencies, the snowball is effective), but the 2014 study investigates why this might be in much more detail, and proposes a full mathimatical model for the actions of human agents in paying off the debt (it looks like a great read, and doesn't seem to be paywalled). They also offer experimental results on a different set of tasks, showing that humans both i) perform tasks faster (voluntarily) when the tasks are ordered from fastest to slowest instead of slowest to fastest or randomly ii) humans are more likely to complete the entire set of tasks when they are ordered from shortest to longest than the other way round (71% completion rate vs. 48%!), or randomly (71% vs. 58%!).

There is a burst of energy when you turn them on, but its equivalent to 2 seconds of run time. Also the light lifetime is not seriously affected by turning it off and then on again occasionally.\n\n\n  The energy consumed to start a typical lamp is the equivalent of 2 seconds running time, so it is wrong to say it takes a lot of power to start them. It is true there is a current surge but this takes place in less than one-eighth of a second and because it happens so quickly it takes very little energy.\n\n\nThe Mythbusters performed a practical experiment to measure the amount of power required to turn on various lights compared to their steady-state consumption when on. They found the following:\n\n\n  Based on the amount of energy consumed turning on the bulb, they were able calculated how long the bulb would have to be turned off in order to make it worth the energy savings, i.e. \u201cIt\u2019s best to turn off the bulb if you are leaving the room for\u201d:\n  \n  \n  Incandescent: 0.36 seconds\n  CFL: 0.015 seconds\n  Halogen: .51 seconds\n  LED: 1.28 seconds\n  Fluorescent: 23.3 seconds\n  \n  \n  In other words, its almost always best to turn the bulb off. Even the 23 seconds for the fluorescent lights isn\u2019t very long, and the rest of the times are pretty much blinks of an eye.\n  \n  It is true that switching on/off fluorescents reduces lamp life but lamps are designed to be switched on/off up to seven times a day without any effect on their life. How many times a day do your colleagues switch on/off to save energy? Probably not enough times to reduce the lamp life.\n\n\nAddressing the last part of the question is harder.\n\n\n  Is there any light source that was in popular use 15 years ago that uses more energy to be turned off and on that leaving it on for 30 minutes?\n\n\nAt risk of doing some Own Research, some back of the envelope calculations suggest that this is unlikely. A typical 4 foot flourescent tube consumes 36 watts, and a light fitting will often contain two tubes, making a total steady-state power consumption of 72 watts. If the starting process takes 5 seconds then to take as much energy in those 5 seconds as it takes during 30 minutes of continuous operation the light fitting would have to draw 72x30x60/5 watts, which is about 26kW. At the UK standard of 240 volts that would be 108 amps, or about 8 times the power of an electric kettle. For US 110 volt circuits it would require 236 amps.

It can be a classic sign of iron deficiency on physical exam.*  The nails of iron-deficient patients may also become brittle and/or split lengthwise.\n\n\n\nSome form of pica is present in about half of cases of iron deficiency.  It describes a broad range of eating disorders, often associated with mineral deficiencies, where a person will compulsively eat or chew on an unusual substance.  Common examples are ice, clay, laundry starch, hair, and the classic, lead paint chips.  However nailbiting itself has not been classified as a form of pica, possibly because it's so common among people without any nutritional deficit.  Nailbiting (fancy medical word: onychophagia) is overwhelmingly attributed to anxiety, general compulsive behavior, or just being a kid.\n\nSo it's not inconceivable that an iron-deficient person with a tendency to put unusual things in their mouth and brittle, misshapen nails might start chewing on them.

The\n  experimental collaborations are individual entities, funded\n  independently from CERN. CERN is a member of each experiment, and\n  contributes to the budget of CMS and LHCb at the 20% level, 16% for\n  ALICE and 13% for ATLAS. TOTEM is a much smaller experiment, with a\n  total material cost of about 6.5 million CHF. The CERN share of this\n  is, however, 30%.\n\n\n4.6 CHF converted to dollars is $5,054,940,000.00 according to Google's conversion tool.  This number is the number that the LHC actually cost to build, and does not include the budget for operation nor the repairs done in 2008 and 2009. \n\nAlthough this article from Popular Science(PopSci) states that the LHC had a construction cost of $7.82 billion.  This figure may be the initial cost plus the cost of repairs that had to be done, it does not say. It also shows that the LHC has an annual operating budget of 1.2 billion (Numbers are on a picture, so I cannot direct quote them).  Which if you add the 7.82 billion and add 1.2 bil 4 times for the operating cost for the years of 2008-2012, which is when they found the Higgs boson particle, you get 12.62 billion. \n\nAccording to Forbes though...\n\n\n  The Large Hadron Collider was first turned on in August of 2008, then\n  stopped for repairs in September until November 2009. Taking all of\n  those costs into consideration, the total cost of finding the Higgs\n  boson ran about $13.25 billion.\n\n\nThe 10 bil number that you have quoted could be the combination of the initial cost, repairs, and the annual budget that it took to find the Higgs boson particle.  \n\nYou have posted articles from 2008, the 4.4 bil figure, and 2010, the 10 bil figure.  So at the time of the 2008 article, 4.4 bil was roughly correct depending on the currency that was used.  In 2010 the 10 bil figure was roughly correct.  By using the number supplied by PopSci, in 2010 the cost came to $10.22 billion. \n\nSo to sum it up, Both figures appear to be correct at the times that they were written, but neither is correct now.  The total cost to find a Higgs boson particle, which was a major purpose of the LHC, appears to be between 12.62 billion, based off the numbers cited by PopSci and my own calculations, and 13.25 billion based off of Forbes calculations.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/14115#14121", "answerId": "14121"}

The Wikipedia article has a fairly wordy summary of the effect, so I will instead quote from this page (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  The Coriolis Effect is the observed curved path of moving objects relative to the surface of the Earth. Hurricanes are good visual examples. Hurricane air flow (winds) moves counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. This is due to the rotation of the Earth. The Coriolis force assists in setting the circulation of a hurricane into motion by producing a rightward (clockwise) deflection that sets up a cyclonic (counterclockwise) circulation around the hurricane low pressure.\n\n\n(If you are interested in reading further about the details of the Coriolis Effect itself, I would encourage you to read some of the Wikipedia article, as it goes into great detail.)\n\nAs several sources indicate, the Coriolis Effect is not strong enough in bodies of water such as those in bathtubs, sinks, toilets, etc. to reliably influence their rotational direction as they drain. The rotational direction of water in such containers is much more likely to be affected by any combination of the following:\n\n\nPre-existing movement of the water. If the water was already rotating (if even very slowly) before being drained, this will almost certainly affect its rotational direction as it drains.\nThe geometrical shape of the container.\nThe smoothness of the container.\nThe location of the drain.\n\n\nThe Wikipedia article on the Coriolis Effect does mention a 1908 experiment in which a physicist successfully demonstrated the effect with a large tub of water (more than 1000 liters). When the plug was pulled, the water eventually began to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction (same as hurricanes in the northern hemisphere, where the experiment took place). However, the tub used was circular, with a tiny central drain, and the experimenter took great care to eliminate as many disturbances as possible from the water before draining it.\n\nSo, if your sink/toilet/bathtub is sufficiently large, circular, has a tiny central drain, and you let the water completely stop moving before you drain it, you would observe that the rotational direction of the water as it drains is influenced by the Coriolis Effect (i.e. varies by hemisphere). But for the other 99.9999% of the sinks/toilets/bathtubs in the world, the direction in which the water rotates is determined by something else.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/450#451", "answerId": "451"}

{"question": "Do calcified water heaters use more energy?", "questionId": "23802", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/23802", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "Calcification's effect on water heater efficiency depends on the design of the water heater and the type of calcification. The question referred specifically to electric water heaters, however, some of the links were referring to gas water heaters. In a gas water heater, the burner is usually located under and outside of the tank and heats a heat exchanger on the bottom of the tank that transfers heat to the water in the tank. In this configuration, sediment at the bottom of the tank can significantly effect efficiency because it insulates and prevents some of the heat from the burner from being transferred into the water (the heat instead is transferred to the air around the bottom of the burner compartment). Some of the links cited are referring to this effect in gas water heaters, not an electic water heater.\n\nIn an electric water heater, the element(s) generally are located inside the tank some distance from the bottom of the tank. Sediment on the bottom of the tank has little effect on efficiency, in fact, the sediment may actually provide additional insulation for the small amount of heat that can be lost out of the bottom of the tank. If there is so much sediment at the bottom of the tank that it builds up high enough to cover the heating element, the element will quickly overheat and burn out because the large amount of heat it produces will not be transferred quickly to the water (it will be concentrated in the sediment around the element instead).\n\nCalcification can form on the heating element itself if the anode is not properly maintained. In this case, the minerals can act as an insulator around the element, however, the insulating effect is minimal. Limestone actually has a higher thermal conductivity than water itself (although water in the liquid state transfers heat more quickly because of convection). The tiny insulating effect of the calcification around the element will cause the element to operate at a slightly higher temperature. This has multiple, but insignificant effects. First, the higher temperature will cause that heat to transfer more quickly through the calcification (although not as fast as it would if the element were in direct contact with the water). Second, the higher temperature will cause more heat to conduct through the flange and the electrical supply wires connected to the element assembly. Some of that heat will eventually be lost through the wire's insulation and into the the ambient air around the wire. Third, the extra heat in the wire will slightly increase the resistivity of the wire as a conductor (assuming copper or aluminum wire). That extra resistance will cause a tiny increase in heat loss from the wire. There is another very insignificant effect in that there will be a little more of a time delay in the heat from the element eventually being \"seen\" by the thermostat. This increase in the hysteresis of the system will mean that the water temperature will cycle to a very slightly higher temperature and thus there will be a very slight increase of general heat loss through the tank's insulation. (This is the same effect as setting the temperature a tiny bit higher: The higher the water temperature, the more heat is lost through the walls of the tank.)\n\nAll of those effects of direct calcification on the element are insignificant compared to the amount of heat involved in heating a hot water heater, so it is safe to say that direct calcification on the electric heating element has no significant effect on efficiency. The website that claimed that there could be a 40% loss of efficiency was also selling some kind of product to prevent it, so I would question the validity of the claims from that website.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/23802#23895", "answerId": "23895"}

In a direct response to this article, a peer scientist criticizes the methods and conclusions of the claimed paper. I am not qualified to sort out which of them is correct, but the criticisms seem valid to me.\n\nThis is definitely not a settled scientific question.\n\n\n\nBackground on the claim\n\nThe paper in the claim, which I will refer to as the claim paper, finds that homosexuals score higher on \"Eysenck\u2019s orthogonal personality scales Neuroticism and Psychoticism.\" The claiming paper cites scientific articles that find that these measures are correlated with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, antisocial behavior and conduct problems, and suicidal behavior.\n\nThe paper goes on to conclude that there may be a genetic basis that causes both neuroticism and psycopathy as well as homosexuality.\n\nThe claiming paper does not look at mental illness directly, nor does it sequence anyone's genes or look at genetic markers.\n\nThis followup paper by the same authors, makes a much more clear claim about a genetic cause.\n\n\n\nDo the results of this study match the results of other studies in the scientific literature? To answer this, I began by reading the articles reviewed in this article's introduction.\n\nA. This meta-analysis read 25 different studies on homosexuality and mental health. The 25 different studies collectively found that homosexuals were more at risk for depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts as well as drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nB. This study finds that homosexuals reported \"more childhood psychological and physical abuse by parents or caretakers, more childhood sexual abuse, more partner psychological and physical victimization in adulthood, and more sexual assault experiences in adulthood. Sexual orientation differences in sexual victimization were greater among men than among women.\" These things have been linked to a greater severity of mental illness, and are not genetic as the claim paper believes.\n\nC. This section from the intro to the claim paper summarizes findings from  other studies have found similar results to the claim paper.\n\n\n  Bozkurt et al. (2006) found in a sample of Turkish men that homosexuals scored significantly higher on Psychoticism (as well as nonsignificantly higher on Neuroticism) than a matched heterosexual control group and Eisinger et al.\n  (1972) found that homosexual women scored significantly higher than Neuroticism norms. In a small study, however, Wilson (1982) found that homosexual women scored lower than heterosexual women.\n\n\nLiterature Summary: Many other papers find a link between homosexuality and mental illness, although most of these attribute this to environmental factors, like abuse or victimization. A few other papers find a link between homosexuality and neuroticism/psycopathy, but I did not see a claim that there is a genetic causal claim. The claim paper seems to be the first to say that.\n\n\n\nI skimmed a number of the articles that cite the claim paper articles and found that most of them cited the claim paper indifferently. They repeated the results but do not editorialize about this study's quality. Then I found this open letter that criticizes the methods and conclusions of this paper. They list three concrete objections. The easiest to understand, and most directly related to the claimed study is quoted below. (Emphasis mine)\n\n\n  Zeitsch et al. (2011) defined participants as non-heterosexuals if they described their sexual feelings as anything other than \u201cexclusive attraction to the opposite sex.\u201d The majority (59%) of non-heterosexuals in this sample scored a 1 on the Kinsey Scale, describing themselves as \u201cpredominantly heterosexual, only incidentally homosexual.\u201d The study found that people who reported exclusive heterosexuality were less likely to be neurotic than those who reported other values (although the relationship was markedly non-linear: the lowest average neuroticism of all groups was among people who reported a Kinsey score of 4). The study then reported an r of 0.25 between the inferred (via a bivariate Cholesky decomposition) genetic predictors of sexual orientation and genetic determinants of neuroticism.

{"question": "Is corn oil bad for arthritis?", "questionId": "9692", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9692", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "There is no evidence to support this claim. Several studies have concluded that corn oil compounds have beneficial effects on inflammation and arthritis on animal models and may have similar effects on humans.\n\n\n  polyunsaturated fats, also known as omega-6 fatty acids.\n\n\nNot the best sentence. Polyunsaturated fats are triglicerides. The hydrocarbon tails of these constitutes polyunsaturated fatty acids [1]. This represents a class that includes omega 6 fatty acid amongst others [2]. Corn oil contains mostly linoleic acid [3] which is an omega-6 fatty acid and about 0.7 % alpha-linolenic acid [4, 5] which is omega-3. \n\nIt was found that alpha-linolenic has antiinflammatory properties on animal models:\n\n\n  ... the protein and mRNA expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 enzyme were markedly inhibited by ALA in a dose dependent manner. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of ALA might be due to the suppression of the expressions of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA [6]. \n  \n  These results indicate that diet rich in ALA exerted the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects in diabetic rats, which may be beneficial to the prevention and treatment of diabetes [7].\n  \n  ALA (2 and 4 ml/kg, i.p.) and LA (2 and 4 ml/kg, i.p.) were further tested for their efficacy against complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced (0.05 ml) arthritis in albino rats. Following CFA-induced arthritis, ALA and LA were tested for their inhibitory proficiency against COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX in vitro. The present study commends that the anti-inflammatory potential of ALA could be attributed to COX inhibition, in particular, COX-2 [8].\n\n\nBut these effects failed to make a statistical difference on humans:\n\n\n  After a 3-month follow-up, the treatment group showed an increased bleeding time, but the clinical, subjective (global assessment, classification of functional status, joint score index, visual analogue scale, pain tenderness score) and laboratory parameters (haemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) did not show any statistical alterations. AA, EPA and DHA did not change either in spite of a significant increase in alpha-LNA in the treatment group. Thus, 3-month's supplementation with alpha-LNA did not prove to be beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis [9].\n\n\nSo alpha-linolenic fatty acid doesn't have any negative effects on arthritis. Also, corn oil is a poor source of alpha-linolenic acid.\n\nWhat about linoleic acid?\n\n\n  Should we listen to warnings that linoleic acid (LA) promotes inflammation and that Americans would be healthier if they restricted their intake of LA (i.e., vegetable oils)? A recently published systematic review of 15 clinical trials failed to find any support for the \"diet LA causes inflammation hypothesis.\" These findings support current recommendations that a diet with 5 to 10 energy percentage from polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as LA, is healthful and appropriate for most Americans [10].\n  \n  In epidemiologic studies, there is little evidence that suggests linoleic acid contributes to cardiovascular disease, cancer, or inflammation (where inverse correlations may exist). ... It has been suggested that high dietary linoleic acid intake increases the incidence of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and inflammation. The putative mechanism for these adverse health outcomes relates to the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid and the subsequent eicosanoids derived thereof. A couple of recent papers have undermined this theoretical model [11]. \n  \n  None of the studies reported significant findings for a wide variety of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, cytokines, soluble vascular adhesion molecules, or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. The only significant outcome measures reported for higher LA intakes were greater excretion of prostaglandin E2 and lower excretion of 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B(2) in one study and higher excretion of tetranorprostanedioic acid in another. However, the authors of those studies both observed that these effects were not an indication of increased inflammation. We conclude that virtually no evidence is available from randomized, controlled intervention studies among healthy, noninfant human beings to show that addition of LA to the diet increases the concentration of inflammatory markers [12].\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nWikipedia contributors, \"Polyunsaturated fat,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polyunsaturated_fat&amp;oldid=616297496 (accessed July 19, 2014).\nWikipedia contributors, \"Polyunsaturated fatty acid,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid&amp;oldid=606758876 (accessed July 19, 2014). \nWikipedia contributors, \"Corn oil,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Corn_oil&amp;oldid=612702158 (accessed July 19, 2014).\nVos E, Cunnane SC.

Time was equally responsible.  However, if you look at the number of actual papers published on the subjects of climate change, you will see that most were actually more concerned about warming:\n\n\n\nOr viewed another way:\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that climate change and global modeling was very new.  Computers of the time were not equipped to handle this sort of calculation.  Even so the 1975 US National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council Report, the most comprehensive study on climate change, and closest to scientific consensus, issued a report. Their basic conclusion was \"...we do not have a good quantitative understanding of our climate machine and what determines its course. Without the fundamental understanding, it does not seem possible to predict climate...\"\n\nThis is in strong contrast with the current position of the US National Academy of Sciences: \"...there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring... It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities... The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.\" \n\nNow looking at the image Fabian has given us, it only shows a little over 100 years, and one may not appreciate the severity of temperature changes.

And they are agreeing with the initial set of measurements. \n\n\n\nAgain, with all this, you will notice statistical fluctuations.  The best way to describe these would almost be to say they are weather.  Weather is not climate.  As shortlived humans, we have a difficult time remembering or projecting more than a few months in advance of our present time on a personal basis.

Salmon numbers are expected to fluctuate and differ for even and odd years due to the two-year spawn times of pink salmon.\n\nFor each year, the harvest of the salmon industry in Alaska is recorded by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. For 2013, a record high of 272 million salmon was recorded. For 2015, the salmon industry also fared particularly well with 263.5 million salmon. For even years, salmon catches are lower. In 2014, the 360,000 ton harvest was comprised of 156.4 million salmon. 2016 was a record-low harvest of 110 million salmon.\n\nThe last odd-year and even-year harvests prior to the fertilization event yielded  177 million salmon and 127 million salmon for 400,000 tons and 330,000 tons, respectively.\n\nComparing odd years, the harvest increased by 128,000 tons. For even years, the harvest increased by 29,000 tons, which does not appear to stand out among the normal fluctuation in years.\n\nYes, the salmon catch increased by over 100,000 tons for the immediate odd-year harvest.\n\nAs @Murphy has pointed, correlation does not imply causation. This is 1 event, and there are natural variations in salmon levels. 13 ocean iron fertilization experiments have been conducted since 1990 (source and source) and they have primarily focused on phytoplankton levels, not salmon levels. In the Nature news article, the director of the Millennium Institute of Oceanography in Concepcio\u0301n, Chile is quoted as saying \"[The research foundation] claim that by producing more phytoplankton, they could help the recovery of the fisheries...We don\u2019t see any evidence to support that claim.\" \n\n\n  The second link mentions a connection between volcanic ash and salmon numbers which would seem to lend some credence but is this generally accepted?\n\n\nThe link between volcanic ash and salmon numbers is poorly understood. According to the National Park Service, \"the longer-term effects [of volcanic activity] are also generally negative.\" Articles that have mentioned volcanic activity and salmon levels (in particular around 2010) are all completely theoretical.\n\nFurther study is needed before making a connection between volcanic activity and salmon levels.\n\n\n  Note: While this question may have been asked in June 2014 , it's still interesting to consider the implications of such iron releases. As recently as May 2017, this topic has still been proposed. Thus, an answer may be warranted.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22089#43584", "answerId": "43584"}

Long answer follows.\n\nWell, strictly speaking BGH or bovine growth hormone is definitely a bad thing, but not in the way that most people mean. Bovine growth hormone, known commercially as Posilac, increases the yield of dairy cows, but comes at the price of higher infection rates and pus content in milk. To combat the infections dairy farmers are forced to put more antibiotics into the cows to keep them healthy. Some of this filters in through the milk, which in turn can lead to resistant bacteria, which is a definite health concern for humans. However, the FDA has found no significant difference between rBGH and non-rBGH milk, Canada banned it's use for it's detrimental affects on animals, but also said that humans have no noticeable detrimental effects from rBGH milk. \n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK15180/#A24152\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm130321.htm\n\nhttp://www.sustainabletable.org/issues/antibiotics/ \n\nFor beef cattle the issue remains the same the FDA has found no link to any sort of health issues related to using either natural or artificial hormones.

In 1994, the Journal of the American Medical Association predicted a surplus of 165,000 doctors by 2000.\n\n\nHowever once the looming shortage became apparent, these efforts were reversed.  For example the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) set the goal of increasing medical school enrollment by 30% from 2002 levels by 2015.  Unfortunately they are already behind on this goal.\n\nMore importantly, medical school itself is not the rate-limiting step in training new physicians.  As a recent, excellent article in the Seattle Times points out,\n\n\n  In order to become practicing physicians, graduates must complete at least three years of residency training, usually in large teaching hospitals. Without more residency slots, the number of physicians entering the workforce cannot increase. (If the number of U.S. medical school graduates increased, but the cap were left in place, graduates of U.S. medical schools, who have preference for residency slots, would replace graduates of foreign schools, but that would have no net impact on total physician supply.)\n\n\nThe article goes on:\n\n\n  The logjam in residency openings stems from the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. At that time, the number of residency slots funded by Medicare (the principal source of residency funding) was capped at around 100,000, and that cap has remained in place ever since.\n\n\nThe article also includes a fairly in-depth account of the mid-00's reversal of fears from surplus to shortage which I won't bother to blockquote here.  It's worth reading if you're really interested.\n\nIn summary, while this claim may have had some truth in the past, it is certainly not true now as the major professional organizations are actively lobbying to expand medical education.  Unfortunately at the moment the major limiting factor in that expansion is federal health spending, which in the current political environment is a hard sell even for the powerful AMA lobby.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4561#4703", "answerId": "4703"}
{"question": "Does having late or heavy dinner make you fat?", "questionId": "1996", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1996", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "The majority of our food is actually digested during sleep, so the common argument that \"eating late at night is bad because our metabolism [slows or shuts down] during sleep\" is incorrect.  With that said, there is a correlation between night eating, low self-esteem, reduced daytime hunger, and weight gain among people who are already obese or prone to obesity, however, this correlation does not necessarily imply causation (i.e., the act of eating a late meal does not necessarily provoke these conditions).  It may simply be the case that the types of foods that people prefer to eat late at night are less healthy.  There is still much debate on the subject, however, many scientists agree that meal frequency, as opposed to time, is one of the best predictors for weight gain.  For example, the time between meals is highly correlated to one's waist size.  This makes some intuitive sense, since eating more, smaller meals will help regulate insulin levels, and spikes in insulin levels (which can be caused by large meals and/or large gaps in time between meals) have been linked to weight gain.\n\nI remember hearing on NPR a year or two ago about a study which specifically tried to test the claim that eating late at night is unhealthy.  The study concluded that there was absolutely no correlation between the proximity of mealtime to sleep and weight gain, other than the fact that people tend to choose to eat more unhealthy foods late at night.  I can't seem to find a reference to that study, however.\n\nUpdate: A newer study followed the eating and sleeping patterns of 52 subjects over one week.  They found a correlation between \"late sleepers\" (i.e., people who go to sleep late and wake up late) and high body mass index, and that eating after 8pm was associated with higher body mass index.  A New York Times article summarizing the results of the study makes the further claim that eating late at night leads to weight gain, however, I disagree with that claim on the grounds that correlation does not imply causation.  In fact, that study noted:\n\n\n  Late sleepers consumed more calories at dinner and after 8:00 PM, had higher fast food, full-calorie soda and lower fruit and vegetable consumption.\n\n\nTherefore, I think the results of the study can be interpreted to mean that there is a correlation between eating/sleeping late and a poor diet.\n\nFurthermore back in 2006, the same research team conducted a study on monkeys in which they were fed a diet similar to the average (i.e., high-fat) diet common in the USA.  The only variable was the time of day that the monkeys were fed.  With all else remaining constant, the researchers found no correlation between weight gain and time of feeding.\n\n\n  It was really interesting to see that the monkeys who ate most of their food at night were no more likely to gain weight than monkeys who rarely ate at night.  This suggests that calories cause weight gain no matter when you eat them.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1996#2000", "answerId": "2000"}

Lighting was cited as a contributing factor.\n\n\nHow can it happen:\n\n\n  Lightning Effects  \n  \n  Both the occupants of an aircraft and the aircraft itself are subject\n  to the powerful effects of a lightning strike. The inherent structural\n  design of an aircraft provides the occupants almost complete\n  protection despite the massive amount of current involved. This\n  protection is based on the principle known as the Faraday cage, first\n  devised by the physicist Michael Faraday in 1836.\n  \n  A Faraday cage is a hollow enclosure made of conducting material, such\n  as the hull of an aircraft. In the presence of a strong electric\n  field, any electric charge will be forced to redistribute itself on\n  the outside enclosure, but the space inside the cage remains\n  uncharged. Thus, the metal hull of the aircraft acts as a Faraday\n  cage, protecting the occupants from lightning.\n  \n  Some aircraft are made of advanced composite materials, which \u2014 by\n  themselves \u2014 are significantly less conductive than metal. To overcome\n  this resulting safety problem, a layer of conductive fibers or screens\n  is imbedded between layers of the composite material to conduct the\n  lightning current.\n  \n  Regardless of hull material, the direct effects of lightning on the\n  exterior can also include:\n  \n  \n  Burning or melting at lightning strike points;\n  Increase in temperature;\n  Residual magnetism;\n  Acoustic shock effects;\n  Arcing at hinges, joints and bonding points; and,\n  Ignition of fuel vapors.\n  \n  \n  Accident data indicate that most of these effects are not serious.\n  However, an estimated one-third to one-half of aircraft lightning\n  strikes result in at least some minor damage. Lightning generally\n  enters an aircraft at one location, usually an extremity, and leaves\n  at another.\n  \n  Burn marks are found at the entry and exit point(s) of the strike,\n  although exit points are not present if the energy was dissipated via\n  wicks or rods \u2014 static dischargers whose primary purpose is to bleed\n  off into the surrounding air the static charge build-up that occurs\n  during normal flight.\n  \n  Because many aircraft fly a distance equivalent to several times their\n  own lengths during a lightning discharge, the location of the entry\n  point can change as the discharge attaches to additional points aft of\n  the initial entry point. The location of the exit points may also\n  change.\n  \n  Therefore, for any one strike, there may be several entry or exit\n  points.\n  \n  Occasionally, in more severe strikes, electrical equipment or avionics\n  may be affected or damaged. This potential problem is addressed in\n  modern aircraft design by redundancy. The functions of most critical\n  systems are duplicated, so a lightning strike is unlikely to\n  compromise safety of flight. In most strike events, pilots report\n  nothing more than a temporary flickering of lights or short-lived\n  interference with instruments.\n  \n  The exception is the incidence of positive lightning. Positive\n  lightning strikes \u2014 because of their greater power \u2014 are considerably\n  more dangerous than negative lightning strikes. Few aircraft are\n  designed to withstand such strikes without significant damage.\n\n\nsource Flight Safety Foundation \u201eWhen Lightning Strikes\u201d\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22579#22584", "answerId": "22584"}

This stands for \"Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly\", and is a data record built from ground station observations.\nMaps 2, 3, and 4 (the \"fake\" maps) all list GHCN-M plus ERSST, which stands for \"Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature\". This is an ocean data set, which is merged with the GHCN-M data to form the \"NOAA Merged Land Ocean Global Surface Temperature Analysis (NOAAGlobalTemp)\".\n\n\nSecondly, they list the time frame of their comparison: maps 1 and 2 state that they are \"with respect to a 1981-2010 base period\", while maps 3 and 4 do not. The reason for this, and the base period of the other maps, is explained in this FAQ:\n\n\n  Why do some of the products use different reference periods?\n  The national maps show temperature anomalies relative to the 1981\u20132010 base period. This period is used in order to comply with a recommended World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Policy, which suggests using the latest decade for the 30-year average. \n  For the global-scale averages (global land and ocean, land-only, ocean-only, and hemispheric time series), the reference period is adjusted to the 20th Century average for conceptual simplicity (the period is more familiar to more people, and establishes a longer-term average). \n  The adjustment does not change the shape of the time series or affect the trends within it.\n\n\nSo we have two very different types of graph:\n\n\na graph comparing a single data set in Dec 2016 against available averages within that dataset for the reference period 1981-2010\nseveral graphs comparing a combined analysis of two data sets against averages for the period 1901-2000\n\n\nIt would seem an obvious question to ask how an ocean data set can be used to fill in land temperatures. However, the combined data set does more than just overlay the two sets of observations; details of exactly how it is computed are available in these references:\n\n\nSmith, T.M., R.W. Reynolds, T.C. Peterson, and J. Lawrimore, 2008: Improvements to NOAA's historical merged land\u2013ocean surface temperatures analysis (1880\u20132006); Journal of Climate, 21, 2283\u20132296, doi:10.1175/2007JCLI2100.1\nVose, R.S., D.

The GHCN-M data has not benefited from this \"smoothing\", so instead shows smaller patches of data; and it contains absolute temperatures, not deviations from average, so can only be plotted where there is enough to form a meaningful comparison.\n\nSimilarly, you might question why a dataset would contain enough data for an average across 1901-2000, but not for 1981-2010. The GHCN-M overview page explains that the dataset was first produced in the 1990s, but composed out of existing historical records. So at the relatively high resolution of the data set, a particular grid point might have values for 1900 to 1980, but none since, while a neighbouring grid point has only recent data. The map of station ages on this page shows very few long-established points in Africa, which would be consistent with the theory that map 1 is missing Africa data because of a lack of consistently placed observations to compare.\n\nTo be clear, the \"missing data\" on map 1 does not mean that there are currently no measuring stations in Central Africa (the location map above shows plenty); it also probably does not mean there weren't any in the period 1981-2010 (I would be very surprised if there weren't). What it probably means is that the measuring stations currently in place are different from those that were in place between 1981 and 2010, meaning that comparisons must be made based on larger analysed areas.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/37119#37147", "answerId": "37147"}

The Luscher Color Test being a personality test based entirely on color preference. This is probably what current online personality tests that use color preference are based on, but most of this old literature is not very easy to access.  \n\nMore recent research by Rense Lange and Jason Rentfrow (2007) indicates that there is definitely a correlation between color preference and personality traits when you look at a large group of people. To some extent, it is possible to actually predict personality traits from color preference. Regarding color preference and the Sixteen Personality Factor questionnaire, Lange and Rentfrow state: \n\n\n  respondents\u2019 color preferences provide powerful\n  predictors of their personalities. The highest correlation is obtained for\n  Factor H (Social Boldness).\n\n\nSo there is definitely some truth to the idea, but using only color preference is not optimal when trying to predict personality traits. It would be of more value as one predictor in a larger set of predictors, when trying to predict a person's personality somewhat accurately.\nFor more on this subject, see Color and Personality: Strong's Interest Inventory and Cattell's 16PF\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/26664#26686", "answerId": "26686"}

From University of Washington Big G Measurement:\n\n\n  Since Cavendish first measured Newton's Gravitational constant 200 years ago, \"Big G\" remains one of the most elusive constants in physics. The value of big G tells us how much gravitational force acts between two masses separated by a known distance. In Einstein's language of general relativity, it tells us the amount of space-time curvature due to a given mass. Together with Planck's constant and the speed of light it is considered to be one of the most fundamental constants in nature. Big G is a necessary ingredient in determining the mass of the earth, the moon, the sun and the other planets.\n  \n  Several measurements in the past decade did not succeed in improving our knowledge of big G's value. To the contrary, the variation between different measurements forced the CODATA committee, which determines the internationally accepted standard values, to increase the uncertainty from 0.013% for the value quoted in 1987 to the twelve times larger uncertainty of 0.15% for the 1998 \"official\" value. This situation is an embarrassment to modern physics, considering that the intrinsic strength of electromagnetism, for instance, is known 2.5 million times more precisely and is steadily being improved. (The situation of G becomes more understandable if one considers the weakness of gravity: the total gravitational force twisting on the pendulum of a typical Cavendish torsion balance is only equivalent to the weight of a bacteria and that small force must be measured very precisely.)\n\n\nSince we are talking about physics, this is true to the best of our current understanding. \n\nThe question of how/why do we know that G (and other constants) are indeed constant was addressed in Physics.SE: What is the proof that the universal constants (G, \u0127, ...) are really constant in time and space?\n\nRegarding the claim that the data isn't made public. I couldn't find any evidence that labs are constantly remeasuring and updating G and I couldn't find that this data is hidden. The data is made public through journal articles.

A predictive test is not accurate at the individual level unless the criteria being measured matches perfectly with the criteria being predicted, and as shown below this is not the case for IAT's.\n\nAccording to this meta-analysis of 122 research papers representing 14,900 subjects, implicit association tests can predict unconscious bias regarding intergroup behavior which would not have been predicted by conscious self-reporting of bias. However, all other forms of bias examined in the meta-analysis were predicted better through explicit self-reporting than through IAT's. Furthermore, a combination of implicit tests and self-reporting of bias results in better predictions than predictions made with an IAT alone for all types of bias.\n\nRegardless of the type of bias being measured, overall the IAT's had a predictive validity of 0.274, and the explicit tests had a predictive validity of 0.361. This is far short of the '1' needed to perfectly predict individual behavior. A value of 0.35 is considered a decent value for predictive validity, so IAT's can be considered a below-average estimation of bias.\n\n\n\nThe Study: The meta-analysis aggregated 122 research papers that examined the predictive validity of both IAT's, such as the one mentioned in the OP, and explicit tests, such as self-reporting of a subject's conscious thoughts when presented with some situation. The overall results of the meta-analysis can be seen in the following graph:\n\n\n\nEssentially, for Black-White(and any two other groups) interracial behavior, such as whether a subject is more likely to associate weapons with black Americans or white Americans, IAT's offered a better prediction of behavior than explicit self-reporting of the subject's conscious beliefs. From the paper:\n\n\n  For 32 samples with criterion measures involving Black\u2013White interracial behavior, predictive validity of IAT measures significantly exceeded that of self-report measures.\n\n\nHowever, IAT's fail to predict bias in other areas, particularly in the fields of consumer products, political preferences, and clinical phenomena (phobias, anxieties, etc.):\n\n\n  In several other topic domains \u2014 especially consumer preferences, political preferences, and clinical phenomena \u2014 it was strongly evident that self-report measures predicted criterion variance not predicted by IAT measures.\n\n\nFurthermore, when combined the predictive validity of both implicit and explicit tests increased when the IAT-explicit correlation (IEC) was examined:\n\n\n  The finding that IEC magnitude was positively associated with predictive validity for both ICCs and ECCs was expected from reasoning that, when IAT and self-report measures agree, the constructs that they measure will likely reinforce each other in determining behavior... Confirming this expectation, IEC magnitude positively predicted 29.9% of the variability of ICC effect sizes and 34.3% of the variability of ECCs (see Tables 4 and 5).\n\n\nIn short, unconscious interracial bias can be better predicted by IAT's than by explicit self-reporting, though other types of unconscious bias are better predicted by self reporting. Regardless of the type of bias, if the results of explicit and implicit tests match then bias can be reliably predicted. However, the predictive value for both is (far) less than 1, so a perfect prediction is not possible.

The tree is widely cultivated and introduced, since an early period in human history, and has various uses as a food and traditional medicine.\n\n\nSource\n\nThe U.S. based National Institute of Health conducted a vast randomised, double-blind study on the efficacy and effects of Ginkgo biloba over various conditions, including its effect on memory.\n\nThe results on cognitive decline are quite clear cut (my emphasis):\n\n\n  Although the herb Ginkgo biloba is widely marketed and used to improve cognitive health in aging, adequate scientific evidence of its effect on long-term cognitive functioning has been lacking. In a recent study, NCCAM-funded researchers analyzed data from the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory (GEM) study to determine ginkgo\u2019s effect on cognitive health in older adults.\n  \n  The GEM study\u2014the largest of its kind to date\u2014was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 3,069 community-dwelling adults aged 72 to 96, conducted in multiple academic medical centers in the United States between 2000 and 2008. The median followup time was 6.1 years. Participants, who had normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment when they entered the study, received 120 mg of ginkgo or an identical-appearing placebo twice daily, and underwent a variety of cognitive tests over the course of the study.\n  \n  Compared with placebo, ginkgo did not lessen cognitive decline. Researchers found no evidence of an effect on cognitive decline in general, or on memory, attention, visual-spatial construction, language, or executive functions. There were no differences by age, sex, race, education, or baseline cognitive status.\n\n\nAccording to the Ginkgo bilboa Wikipedia page, there has been some controversy. However, when two experiments have the same methodology (randomised, double blind), then size tends to be a good predictor of correctness, and this leaves the NIH experiment as the most valuable on the topic. \n\nIn fact, the Cochrane Collaboration also reviewed prior experiments and found no effects.\n\n\n  The results from the more recent trials showed inconsistent results for cognition, activities of daily living, mood, depression and carer burden. Of the four most recent trials to report results three found no difference between Ginkgo biloba and placebo, and one reported very large treatment effects in favour of Ginkgo biloba.\n  \n  There are no significant differences between Ginkgo biloba and placebo in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events.\n  \n  A subgroup analysis including only patients diagnosed with Alzhiemer's disease (925 patients from nine trials) also showed no consistent pattern of any benefit associated with Ginkgo biloba.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8335#8336", "answerId": "8336"}

{"question": "Is the Rorschach test a reliable diagnostic tool for psychologists?", "questionId": "7424", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7424", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "This seems to be one of our questions which have to be answered with \"Not sure\" .\n\nThere seems to be a dispute about the reliability of the Rorschach test under psychologists. The test also seems to have been hyped greatly over its actual usefulness. Some research papers try to analyze the usefulness of the test to  to differ between certain disorders, like psychosis and non-psychosis disorders. However, different papers came to opposite results as shown below.\n\n\n\nThe pros and cons of the Rorschach test seems to be analyzed from both sites by Wood, Nezworski and Garb, which first published a book against Rorschach test What\u2019s Wrong With the Rorschach? (2003):\n\n\n  What's Wrong With the Rorschach? challenges the validity and utility of the Rorschach and explains why psychologists continue to judge people by their reactions to ink blots, in spite of a half century of largely negative scientific evidence.\n  \n  What's Wrong With the Rorschach? offers a provocative critique of one of the most widely applied and influential - and still intensely controversial - psychological tests in the world today. Surveying more than fifty years of clinical and scholarly research, the authors provide compelling scientific evidence that the Rorschach has relatively little value for diagnosing mental illness, assessing personality, predicting behavior, or uncovering sexual abuse or other trauma. In this highly engaging, novelistic account of the Rorschach's origins and history, the authors detail the wealth of scientific evidence that the test is of questionable utility for real-world decision making.\n\n\nAn excerpt has been published by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry: The Rorschach Inkblot Test, Fortune Tellers, and Cold Reading.\nThere is also a book review available, which claims that the authors fail to make a case against Rorschach.\n\nHowever, the same authors as above also wrote the following article\nWhat's Right with the Rorschach? and point out there that there seem to be valid areas for the test.\n\n\n  In the present article, we discuss the validity and clinical utility of the Rorschach as a measure of intelligence, thought disorder, and other psychological characteristics. We also summarize potential uses of the test in research and psychotherapy. Controversy has surrounded the Rorschach throughout most of its history not because it is worthless, but because it has so often been used for the wrong purposes.  \n\n\nThey conclude:\n\n\n  Paradoxically, although the Rorschach is held in disrepute by many research psychologists, it has achieved its greatest successes as a research tool. Its value as a measure of thought disorder in schizophrenia research is well accepted. It is also used regularly in research on dependency, and, less often, in studies on hostility and anxiety.\n  \n  Furthermore, substantial evidence justifies the use of the Rorschach as a clinical measure of intelligence and thought disorder. Although clinicians should normally rely on well-established tests such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013Third Edition (Wechsler, 1997) to measure intelligence, and on clinical interviews to assess thought disorder, there may be times when the Rorschach can usefully supplement these \u201cfront-line\u201d methods. In addition, the Rorschach may be useful as an exploratory technique in some forms of insight-oriented psychotherapy.\n  \n  The virtues of the Rorschach are modest but genuine. If, over its long history, the test had been promoted solely for the uses identified here, it probably would have been less popular among psychologists, but also far less controversial. It remains to be seen whether clinical psychologists of the future can learn to accept the limitations of the Rorschach while respecting its strengths. Otherwise, it will continue to be promoted for purposes for which it has no usefulness and will inevitably be a flashpoint for controversy. \n\n\n\n\nThere are also contradictory research results on the use of the Rorschach test to differ between certain types of disorder: \n\nDifferentiating adolescents at clinical high risk for psychosis from psychotic and non-psychotic patients with the Rorschach:\n\n\n  This study was designed to assess cognitive functioning in a clinical sample of adolescents with heterogeneous psychiatric diagnoses, with a specific focus on patients at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. The sample comprised 22 patients identified at CHR for psychosis, 67 psychotic and 187 non-psychotic, non-CHR patients. Neuropsychological assessment was conducted as part of the clinical examination and treatment, including Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)-III and/or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III measures of verbal comprehension, perceptual organisation, working memory and processing speed, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) measures of executive function, and the Rorschach Comprehensive System measures of perceptual and thinking accuracy. Patients at CHR for psychosis did not significantly differ from other patient groups in terms of intellectual or executive functions. The Rorschach Perceptual Thinking Index (PTI) distinguished patients at CHR for psychosis from those diagnosed as having non-psychotic disorders, but not from those diagnosed as psychotic. Our results suggest perceptual and thought disturbance as an important indicator of vulnerability to psychosis.\n\n\nwhile the following comes to the opposite result:\n\nValidity of Rorschach Inkblot scores for discriminating psychopaths from nonpsychopaths in forensic populations: A meta-analysis.:\n\n\n  Gacono and Meloy (2009) have concluded that the Rorschach Inkblot Test is a sensitive instrument with which to discriminate psychopaths from nonpsychopaths. We examined the association of psychopathy with 37 Rorschach variables in a meta-analytic review of 173 validity coefficients derived from 22 studies comprising 780 forensic participants. All studies included the Hare Psychopathy Checklist or one of its versions (Hare, 1980, 1991, 2003) and Exner's (2003) Comprehensive System for the Rorschach. Mean validity coefficients of Rorschach variables in the meta-analysis ranged from \u2212.113 to .239, with a median validity of .070 and a mean validity of .062. Psychopathy displayed a significant and medium-sized association with the number of Aggressive Potential responses (weighted mean validity coefficient = .232) and small but significant associations with the Sum of Texture responses, Cooperative Movement = 0, the number of Personal responses, and the Egocentricity Index (weighted mean validity coefficients = .097 to .159). The remaining 32 Rorschach variables were not significantly related to psychopathy. The present findings contradict the view that the Rorschach is a clinically sensitive instrument for discriminating psychopaths from nonpsychopaths. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)\n\n\nOther studies show that the test is not useful to differ between other patterns, e.g.:\n\nUsing the Rorschach to identify differential psychological and personality patterns of patients diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures:\n\n\n  Psychological and personality patterns were examined amongst a sample of non-epileptic and epileptic individuals using the Rorschach Inkblot Method and Toronto Alexithymia Scale with the intent to identify differentiating psychological characteristics of these samples and to determine Rorschach\u2019s utility in this area. The data collected from these two samples was compared with normative data. Results suggests that participants in both the epileptic and non-epileptic groups are able to experience and express their emotions but have limited coping skills to deal with stress as compared to normative data. Statistically significant differences between the two groups themselves were not identified and, in this study, Rorschach did not provide to be of use in differentiating the two groups.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7424#8632", "answerId": "8632"}

{"question": "Is learning more difficult for older people?", "questionId": "1713", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1713", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "This is an extremely complex topic outlined quite well here (1), and I will try to communicate this the best that I can. As with many things, brain function seems to change as a result of the interaction of two opposing processes, one is the way the brain deteriorates with age, and the other is the way in which it continues to remodel itself in order to compensate for that change. This response is going to deal with non-dementia and non-Alzheimer's related changes.\n\nTo really understand how this works, you need at least a basic understanding of neurogenesis, which is the process by which the body generates new neural cells from the relatively small amount of multipotent stem cells (2) in the nervous system. There is a review of this process here with its relationship to age. There is thought that non-coding RNA networks may play a role (3).\n\nAs far as changes which can be thought of as occurring due to the normal aging process, I'll generalize: There is a noted 10% loss of brain volume after age 80, mainly due to parenchymal shrinking.  Also the normal aging process includes a reduction in rates of available neurotransmitters, and plaque accumulations, and neurofibrillary tangles can occur in the brain as it ages(these are much more likely in the Alzheimer's brain, but can occur as a result of normal aging). A more complete description of this process is available in the review here.\n\nStudies of language aquisition in children have long been a benchmark for evaluatng this concept, with the common thought being it is much easier for children to learn languages than adults, however, this topic has its own complexities, and I'm going to stick to the more general concepts.\n\nEven though our brains deteriorate with age, that is not all they do. We can use cerebral blood flow studies (4). to demonstrate that the brain does undergo a generalized age-related decline, but there is also evidence that activity increases in certain areas, possibly in an attempt to compensate for this decline.  \n\nNeural plasticity (5) is an interesting topic and neurogenesis does continue(6) up to the 80 year range, which seems to indicate we retain that ability to learn and retain what we've learned well on into that decade of life, here is one study which documents the regeneration of neurons in older age. However, the question of whether the ability of the brain is comparable to that of a younger brain is still being observed (7), and of particular debate is the age at which these degenerative changes begin to appear and become measurable, some state this may be as early as the late 20's, some state not until the 50's. \n\nMany factors have been evaluated over the years for an association with this decline, some include the relation of exposure to low-level stress over the years, physical activity, hormone replacement therapy in women, and genetic factors. However, none have yielded any definitive answers.\n\nEvaluation of this correlation was also attempted by evaluating neurological outcomes of children with brain injuries.  However this study associated a younger age with a worse neurological outcome, seeming to indicate that the previous thinking that a younger brain is more malleable, therefore would do a better job recovering may not be exactly true.  However, the counterargument could be made that injury at a critical state of development may produce a greater defecit than one slightly later, when connections have had more time to become solidified. And this concept seems to deal more with the brain's response to injury rather than natural development, but still bears consideration.\n\nIn short, I can not provide any definitive answer, only outline the current state of the science, which seems to allow for significant individual variation and the contribution of a variety of factors.    \n\nAll numbered links will go to studies at pubmed.

An area-weighted scheme is used to reflect the reality that the boxes are smaller near the poles and larger near the equator. Global-average anomalies are calculated on a monthly and annual time scale. Average temperature anomalies are also available for land and ocean surfaces separately, and the Northern and Southern Hemispheres separately. The global and hemispheric anomalies are provided with respect to the period 1901-2000, the 20th century average.\n\n\nI see no reason to doubt the NOAA conclusion that the global monthly temperature for the previous 341 months each was higher than the month's long-term average temperature. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the Earth is warming or has warmed.\n\n\n\nThe data\n\nThe combined mean surface temperature (\u00b0C) based on the years 1901-2000:\n\nJan: 12.0\nFeb: 12.1\nMar: 12.7\nApr: 13.7\nMay: 14.8\nJun: 15.5\nJul: 15.8\nAug: 15.6\nSep: 15.0\nOct: 14.0\nNov: 12.9\nDec: 12.2\n\n\nHere is the combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces from 1880-present, reported as units of 0.01\u00b0C change from the average global mean from 1950-1980 (14.0\u00b0C): http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt\n\nIn that dataset, February 1994 was the most recent month where the average global temperature was lower than the global mean from 1950-1980.\n\nIt appears that the \"long-term average for its respective month\" quoted in the study is not simply the period between 1950-1980, because the claim is false if that is the case.\n\nHowever, if you include a longer period of history before 1950, that pulls the \"long-term average for its respective month\" downward. Whether or not the question's claim is true turns on the definition of \"long-term average for its respective month\".\n\nPedantry\n\n\n  If you're 28 or younger, you haven't experienced a full month of average global temperatures ever in your lifetime.\n\n\nNobody has \"experienced a full month of average global temperatures\", ever. An global average is just an average, and it's totally consistent that the Earth itself has not experienced a full month of average global temperatures, and even more certain that no one person has experienced a full year of temperature that happens to match the global average.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/17445#17447", "answerId": "17447"}

This is what the title and the last paragraph of the question mentions. The \"magnifying glass\" part doesn't really fit with that, IMHO, and could be a different questions by itself.\n\nAccording to Can glass block sun rays that cause skin cancer? (cancer research UK) normal glass windows reduce the UVB part (wavelength range 315\u2013280 nm [1, 2]) but not the UVA part (400\u2013315 nm, [1, 2]):\n\n\n  UVA causes skin ageing and research has now shown that it is also likely to cause skin cancer. UVB causes redness and sunburn and is a major risk factor for all types of skin cancer.\n  \n  Most glass used for windows blocks UVB but not UVA. This means that although glass might reduce the risk of sunburn, it does not prevent long term damage from UVA.\n\n\nImportant here is the part which states that UVB causes sunburn. This is also stated by:\n\nhttp://www.skincancer.org/prevention/uva-and-uvb/understanding-uva-and-uvb\n\n\n  UVB, the chief cause of skin reddening and sunburn, tends to damage the skin's more superficial epidermal layers.\n\n\nand Wikipedia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn:\n\n\n  Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation causes dangerous sunburns and increases the risk of two types of skin cancer [..]\n\n\nFurther sources for the UVB blocking by glass windows are:\n\nhttp://www.smartskincare.com/skinprotection/uv-indoors.html:\n\n\n  Most people believe that ordinary window glass blocks UV radiation, making any other UV protection unnecessary indoors. This is half-truth at best. Window glass blocks UVB but lets much of UVA through.\n\n\nUV exposure in cars (research paper):\n\n\n  UV wavelengths longer than >335 nm were transmitted through car windows, and UV irradiation >380 nm was transmitted through compound glass windscreens\n\n\n(This means they both block UVB (315\u2013280 nm) completely.)\n\nPhotoprotection by window glass, automobile glass, and sunglasses (research paper):\n\n\n  It has been known for some time that window glass filters out UVB and transmits UVA and visible light.\n\n\nNote that this paper mentions that there is also special glass which blocks the whole UV spectrum including UV-A, but normal glass doesn't.\n\nThese bring me to the following conclusions:\n\n\nThe risk of sunburn through a glass window is, depending on the source, either heavily reduced or not existing compared to direct exposure to sunlight. In the first case you could still get a sunburn after a longer time.\nBecause UVA is not blocked at the same time the use of sunscreen is still required in order to avoid skin damage like skin cancer. This is a real danger, because the warning effect of the sunburn is then missing or delayed.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8250#8567", "answerId": "8567"}

This has been one of the less fun topics to research; some of the concepts below are distasteful (but not explicit.)\n\nDepends What 'Normal' Means\n\nIt turns out I accidentally hit on a key issue in the question title \"Do rapists think rape is normal?\"; I need to elaborate on a subtle distinction.\n\nOne issue is whether or not someone sees rape as a common or typical action for men.\n\nAnother issue is whether or not someone sees rapists as \"normal\" - e.g. agrees more with the statement that `Rapists are \"normal\" men.' than the statement `All rapists are mentally sick.'\n\nEven though I do not show whether or not rapists see rape as more common than \"regular\" people, I will show below that they do NOT see rape as more normal than \"regular\" people. \n\nI believe that it is a reasonable leap to think if they don't see rape as any more normal, they won't think that typical men are rapists, and thus this is counter-evidence for the claim made in the question.\n\nThe Evidence\n\nFeild: Survey of 20 rapists and 1174 non-rapists\n\nA key study in this area is by Feild:\n\n\nHubert S. Feild, Attitudes Toward Rape: A Comparative Analysis of Police, Rapists, Crisis Counselors, and Citizens Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 36(2), Feb 1978, 156-179. doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.36.2.156\n\n\nFeild conducted surveys of many men (n=528), many women (n=528), many police officers (n=258), many female counsellors from a rape crisis centre (n=118) and a small number convicted rapists in a mental hospital (n=20).\n\nNote: This was back in 1978. Society's opinions about women and rape have changed a lot in the past 30-odd years [Ref: Segal and Stermac (1985), that I will introduce further below]. \n\nThe surveys asked a number of questions about their attitude to rape, and they were processed to give each person a score along a number of axes. That is, each person was given a rating according to a number of factors:\n\n\nWoman's Responsibility in Rape Prevention;\nSex as Motivation for Rape\nSevere Punishment for Rape\nVictim Precipitation of Rape\nNormality of Rapists\nPower as Motivation for Rape\nFavorable Perception of a Woman After Rape\nResistance as Woman's Role During Rape\n\n\nFactor 5 is the relevant factor for this discussion.\n\nNow, the variability in Factor 5 was partially accounted for by a number of determinants: Race (classified as Black or White), Marital Status, Knowledge about Rape all had a correlated with opinions on Factor 5. For some of the subgroups, some other variables were correlated: For regular Men and Women, their attitude toward women also played a part on their opinion on Factor 5. For police officers, their years of education played a part.\n\nHowever, in the critical question of whether the grouping of the respondents into Citizens, Rapists, Police officers and Counsellors, it turns out Factor 5 is only statistically significantly different for the counsellors. That is, there was not a significant difference between citizens, rapists and police officers when it came to their attitudes about the normality of rape.\n\n\n\nThis is the key table from the study. It is tricky to understand. The important point to notice is that the numbers against \"Normality of Rapists\" under Citizens and under Rapists both have the same a super&shy;script, indicating they are not significantly different (at p &lt; 0.05).\n\nSummarising the weaknesses of this evidence: it's about \"normality\" not frequency, it is from 1978, the sample size of rapists isn't huge and all the rapists were drawn from a mental hospital.\n\nNonetheless, it shows the attitudes of regular people and rapists were not significantly different when it came to the normality of rapists.\n\nSegal and Stermac: Survey of 40 rapists, 40 other offenders and 40 non-rapists\n\nI'm veering a little off-topic here, but I think this addresses some of the questions about the above study.\n\nIn a response to the Feild study, in 1984 Segal and Stermac attempted to address some of its shortcomings.\n\n\nZindel V. Segal and Lana Stermac, A Measure of Rapists\u2019 Attitudes Towards Women International Journal of Law and Psychiatry, Vol 7(3-4), 1984, 437-440. doi: 10.1016/0160-2527(84)90023-2\n\n\nThey increased the sample size to 40 rapists - importantly, they sampled 20 from a mental institution and 20 from a regular prison. They also only took respondents with an above average IQ (the reason for this is unclear).\n\nTo control for institutionalisation, they compared them against 40 non-sex offenders who had been imprisoned. They also compared to 40 citizens, but they were careful to match against equivalent men at the same low socio-economic status and intelligence.\n\nThey used a standard \"Attitudes to Women\" questionnaire. As an aside, they noticed that the community standards for the attitudes for women had changed a lot (become more liberal) since the questionnaire had been first measured, a decade earlier in 1973.\n\nThey were surprised by the results:\n\n\n  Contrary to predictions made, rapists at both centres did not differ from other offenders or from community based males, in their perceptions of women\u2019s roles.\n\n\n...\n\n\n  The findings reported are also consistent with research indicating little difference between rapists and\n  other low SES men on measures of social competence (Segal &amp; Marshall, 1985; Stermac &amp; Quinsey, in press). In fact, in the Segal and Marshall study, only high SES men differed significantly from rapists and low SES controls in their attitudes\n  towards women and on other indices of heterosexual social skill.\n\n\nNow, this study has strayed even further from the original question. It is asking about attitudes to women, not if rape is normal or if rape is common. However, it is important because it supports the view that rapists do not have a vastly different attitudes to their non-sex-offending peers.\n\nFeelgood et al: Survey of 25 rapists, 36 child molesters and 25 violent offenders\n\nAnother survey looking at the attitudes, coping skills and cognitive distortions of rapists was examined as part of a Masters dissertation by Steven Feelgood.\n\n\nSteven Feelgood, Franca Cortoni, Anthony Thompson, Sexual coping, general coping and cognitive distortions in incarcerated rapists and child molesters,Journal of Sexual Aggression, Vol. 11, Iss. 2, 2007, DOI:10.1080/13552600500073657\n\n\n\n  Rapists did not report more support for rape-supportive distortions than the violent offender comparison group. [...]\n  Evaluation of these comparisons was aided by effect sizes. The effect sizes reveal that there may indeed be differences between rapists and the comparison group with respect to cognitive distortions and sexual coping. \n\n\nAgain, rapists did not have strongly different views to their non-sex-offender peers. \n\nThe Conclusion\n\nWhile this isn't a knock-down argument, it is strong evidence against the claim. In study after study, rapists do not have attitudes to rape that differ from similar control groups.\n\nThe evidence certainly isn't as clear cut in the other direction (\"it comes out again and again\") as the original claimant would suggest.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7167#8332", "answerId": "8332"}

The reason for that isn't clear, but there's something going on.\n\nMost peanuts contain aflatoxin, created by mold that forms when crops like peanuts are stored in large masses.  It\u2019s one of the most carcinogenic substances known. Besides the fact that it could cause cancer if enough of it is ingested, there\u2019s also growing suspicion that aflatoxin could be causing an immune system reaction \u2013 an allergy.\n\nPeanut oil contains a moderate amount of monounsaturated fat (46.8% of the total amount of fatty acids present in the peanut oil are monounsaturated fats).

Taste is a sense perceived by special cells that constitute taste buds.

Grandma was right. Just why mixing of boiled and raw water leads to a rapid emptying of the bowel, the science cannot explain yet. But the fact is obvious.\n\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) recommend that water be raised to a temperature of 100\u00b0 C for 60 seconds in order to kill off bacteria and viruses.\n\nWhen you pour water at 100\u00b0 C into a cold container such as a cup (or teapot) at 20\u00b0 C, the water reduces in temperature to about 80\u00b0 C by the time you've finished pouring (I've measured this but have no reference at the moment)\n\nStudies in the UK have found that the average temperature for drinking tea is between 56\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 C\n\nClearly, if you add cold unboiled water to the cup of 80\u00b0 C water in order to reduce the mixtures temperature to 60\u00b0 C, that new water is not going to be raised to 100\u00b0 C for 60 seconds. Therefore any bacteria it contains (if any) may not be killed and may lead to an illness such as the diarrhoea suggested in the question.\n\nScience has no problem explaining this commonsense advice for people with unsafe water supplies.

{"question": "Do Personal Development Seminars bring real long-term benefits?", "questionId": "4551", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4551", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "The short answer is It Depends. There are lots of factors involved in whether any adult learning method is effective. I've tried to cover the major points below. \n\nThere are many unknowns in the training effectiveness field. We can say that in any training situation, some people learn more than others, but the question is how to determine what affects whether the training helps. (And yes, I'm considering self-development seminars as a subset of training -- since that's the general academic term for adult learning in a non-academic setting.)\n\nNeeds Analysis\n\nThe first point, and I suspect what many people worry about in the self-improvement classes (as opposed to therapy) is that one-size fits all doesn't. The best trainers first perform a needs analysis to make sure that they know what people need to learn. See Assessing training needs: Critical levels of analysis. Training and development in organizations and A Proactive Model for Training Needs Analysis as sample articles. Or look at this Google Scholar search for more.)\n\nIf the people conducting a self-improvement seminar don't conduct a needs analysis, they're going to end up sticking to basic concepts that may or may not help the attendees. There are certain concepts that you can cover in any such seminar -- such as the fact that if you want things to change, you have to take action. If you keep doing the same thing, nothing will change. (Which, of course, is common sense. But there are psychological motivations that keep people from acting -- and good self-improvement seminars would help people identify some of those factors for themselves.)\n\nDesign of Class and Teacher Style\n\nIn addition, the design of the training and the effectiveness of delivery affect the results. See Effectiveness of training in organizations: A meta-analysis of design and evaluation features for a statistical analysis of design factors. For discussion of the affect of the trainer's style on results, see The relationship between verbal teacher immediacy behaviors and student learning or this Google scholar search.\n\nEffectiveness Measures\n\nIn general, we can quantify the effectiveness of training by two means -- information retention and behavior change. \n\nOne site I found references an article that suggests that the initial training transfer rate is 62% (Saks, A. M., &amp; Belcourt, M. (2006). An investigation of training activities and transfer of training in organizations. Human Resource Management, Winter 2006, Vol. 45, No. 4, Pp. 629\u00ad648). In other words, immediately after training, attendees retain about 62% of the information presented in that training. The numbers drop over time, however. In addition, that rate is simply for information. \n\n10 to 20% of training transfers to actual job performance. (Baldwin, T.T, Ford, J.K (1988), Transfer of training: a review and directions for future research, Personnel Psychology, Vol. 41 pp.63-105.)\n\nOutside Factors: Attitudes, Context, etc.\n\nSo why so little change? There are a number of outside factors that can affect how well attendees at a training learn. \n\nFor example, the attitudes and motivation of the trainees can affect how well they integrate what they learn. (Trainee's Attributes and Attitudes: Neglected Influences on Training Effectiveness. Academy of Management Review. 1996) Also see The Influence of Trainee Attitudes on Training Effectiveness: Test of a Model and Toward an Integrative Theory of Training Motivation: A Meta-Analytic Path Analysis of 20 Years of Research.\n\nSimilarly, factors external to the training -- such as the personality of the trainees and the work environment of the people being trained can affect how well the training works (Training Effectiveness: Accounting for Individual Characteristics and the Work Environment). \n\nSpecific Seminars\n\nNow, having said all that, there are some studies on particular types of personal development seminars. For example, EST was discussed in Observations on 67 patients who took Erhard Seminars Training, and in Psychiatric disturbances associated with Erhard Seminars Training: II. additional cases and theoretical considerations. You can always try to learn more about any particular system by doing similar research. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4551#4562", "answerId": "4562"}

Per Joao Tome\u0301-Carneiro et.al in 2013, Resveratrol (RES) exerts cardioprotective benefits through the improvement of inflammatory markers, atherogenic profile, glucose metabolism and endothelial function according to the clinical trials conducted so far. These effects have been observed using both high and low doses of Resveratrol and both in healthy volunteers and medicated patients. However, the specific mechanisms by which this may occur are not yet clear. More trials are needed to confirm other possible effects and mechanisms. The promising neurodegenerative and cancer chemopreventive effects of Resveratrol in animal models have not been yet confirmed in humans. \n\nA classical drawback for this molecule has been the poor bioavailability of RES despite the effects observed. A recurrent criticism used by some physicians/pharmacologists is that 'RES cannot exert benefits because it is rapidly metabolized and its presence in the bloodstream is negligible to justify any effect'. However, the effects exist. More research should focus on identifying the actual metabolites, signals or mediators responsible for these effects.\n\n\n  In addition, and to overcome the poor bioavailabilty of RES, intense research has been performed to enhance its bioavailability. After RES intake, the actual metabolite responsible (if any) for the effects exerted is still unknown. The specific activity associated to known metabolites has been scarcely investigated. \n  \n  The objective of using high doses of RES with a pharmacological use is still unclear.

{"question": "Did both higher temperatures and an ice age exist at CO2 levels ten times the present?", "questionId": "22285", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22285", "category": "climate-change", "categoryId": 1, "answer": "\n  Is it true that both higher and much lower temperatures existed while\n  CO2 levels were ten times higher than today?\n\n\nYes.  Is that surprising?  No.  The reason this is not surprising is that CO2 is not the only factor controlling global temperatures, and nobody claims that it is (although it is perhaps the single most dominant factor on many time scales).\n\nHowever, if you look at timescales as long as 500 million years, then solar brightening becomes an important factor.  It has long been known that the luminosity of stars increases with time, the \"theory predicts that the solar luminosity has risen steadily from about 70% of its current value during the last 4.7 x 109yr\".   This leads to a what is known as the \"Feint young sun paradox\", first pointed out by Carl Sagan (a name that ought to be familiar) and George Mullen.  The paradox being how did the Earth remain ice free for large parts of its geological history, with so little solar irradiance compared to modern times.  The resolution of the paradox being that perhaps greenhouse gasses were present in the atmosphere in larger quantities at that time (although it isn't actually quite as simple as that).\n\nThat there were warmer temperatures in the past with higher levels of CO2 is easily explained, as CO2 is a greenhouse gas, that is just what you would expect.  That there could have been times when it was colder with more CO2 than today is explainable by the fact that the sun is significantly brighter now than during the Ordovician (i.e. 450 million years ago), when there was a glaciation with CO2 levels higher than they are now.\n\nNote also the radiative forcing of CO2 only rises logarithmically in its concentrations, i.e. you get a constant increase in equilibrium temperature per doubling of CO2.  Thus CO2 concentrations being 10 times higher in the Ordovician does not mean that it had ten times the effect on climate than it does now.  So a substantial decrease in solar luminosity, is going to need an even more substantial change in greenhouse gas concentrations to avoid a snowball Earth.\n\nSadly Dr Moore is raising a question, but has taken no efforts whatsoever to find out the answer.  This is not very impressive given that typing \"Ordovician glaciation\" into Google scholar would have provided some very relevant papers on the topic, such as \n\n\n  Reconciling Late Ordovician (440 Ma) glaciation with very high (14X)\n  CO2 levels\n  \n  Thomas J. Crowley Steven K. Baum\n  \n  Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres (1984\u20132012) Volume 100,\n  Issue D1, pages 1093\u20131101, 20 January 1995\n  \n  Geochemical data and models suggest a positive correlation between\n  carbon dioxide changes and climate during the last 540 m.y. The most\n  dramatic exception to this correlation involves the Late Ordovician\n  (440 Ma) glaciation, which occurred at a time when CO2 levels may have\n  been much greater than present (14\u201316X?). Since decreased solar\n  luminosity at that time only partially offset increased radiative\n  forcing from CO2, some other factor needs to be considered to explain\n  the glaciation. Prior work with energy balance models (EBMs) suggested\n  that the unique geographic configuration of Gondwanaland at that time\n  may have resulted in a small area of parameter space permitting\n  permanent snow cover and higher CO2 levels. However, the crude snow\n  and sea ice parameterizations in the EBM left these conclusions open\n  to further scrutiny. Herein we present results from four experiments\n  with the GENESIS general circulation model with CO2 levels 14X greater\n  than present, solar luminosity reduced 4.5%, and an orbital\n  configuration set for minimum summer insolation receipt. We examined\n  the effects of different combinations of ocean heat transport and\n  topography on high-latitude snow cover on Gondwanaland. For the\n  no-elevation simulations we failed to simulate permanent summer snow\n  cover. However, for the slightly elevated topography cases (300\u2013500\n  m), permanent summer snow cover occurs where geological data indicate\n  the Ordovician ice sheet was present. These results support the\n  hypothesis based on EBM studies. Further results indicate that\n  although average runoff per grid point increases substantially for the\n  Ordovician runs, the decreased land area results in global runoff\n  10\u201330% less than present, with largest runoff reductions for flat\n  topography. This response has implications for CO2-runoff/weathering\n  parameterizations in geochemical models. Finally, simulated tropical\n  sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are the same or only marginally warmer\n  than present. This result is consistent with evidence from other warm\n  time intervals indicating small changes in tropical SSTs during time\n  of high CO2.\n\n\nThat temperatures have been both higher and lower in the past and that CO2 levels were generally higher in the (geological) past.  There is a good discussion of temperature and CO2 proxies at RealCLimate.  Here is a noce picture of the proxy data from the IPCC AR4 (via RealClimate)\n\n\n\nSadly climate skeptic blogs are full of this kind of story, where someobdy has heard an apparently paradoxical combination of bits of science but not bothered to check the actual state of scientific knowledge, before rushing off to make grand claims.  Google scholar however makes this fact checking relatively straightforward these days, perhaps we should ask why the likes of Moore apparently don't use it.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22285#22367", "answerId": "22367"}

It also notes that cows are responsible for 65% of those emissions, for a total of 9.45% of emissions. As for cars, according to the EPA once again, \"light duty vehicles\" (ie, cars) make up 61% of transportation emissions, for a total of 8.54% of total emissions.

Almost 100% of the input energy that goes in is converted to heat[1]. For a newer heater to be 50% more efficient, it would have to use about 67% of the energy to give the same heat - which is difficult, because the original heater is already 100% efficient, so this new one would have to be 150% efficient.\n\nCeramic materials are very good electrical insulators and have excellent thermal conductivity. The only difference between his ceramic heater and your normal electric heater is the element is probably wrapped around a ceramic core and this then heats up the outer plate, whereas yours just has elements and relies on natural convection to circulate and spread the heat. \n\nBoth will be equally efficient at providing heat energy, but they provide it in different ways. Maybe the heat plate is better for heating up one part of a room, but the convection heater is good for the whole room, for example. If you were only using one part of the room, then it would be less efficient to heat up all of it.\n\nThere are heating systems that are more than 100% efficient - they are known as heat pumps. They are typically in excess of 300% efficient. However, a heat pump would require an external connection to outside the building to work, as it works by using the thermal energy from outside (and electricity is only drawn to move the heat one way.) And, they are very expensive.\n\n\nhttp://www.conservingelectricity.com/ElectricSpaceHeaters.asp\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9167#9170", "answerId": "9170"}
{"question": "Does standard table salt contain anti-caking agents that prevent salts from disolving in our body?", "questionId": "32449", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/32449", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Short answer: Yes, commercial table salt contains anti-caking agents; No, these do not prevent salt from dissolving in your body. Anti-caking agents are added to prevent the salt crystals from sticking together due to air humidity. They achieve this by reacting with water before the salt can. Without them you would have a hard time getting finely ground salt out of a salt shaker.\n\nThere are different agents in use. Sodium aluminosilicate seems to be the most common agent in the USA, while in Europe sodium and potassium ferrocyanide are used. They should be mentioned in the list of ingredients of any commercial salt you buy. None of these prevent salt from dissolving in liquid water, as you can easily demonstrate by adding a spoon of salt to a glas of water and stirring. The solubility of sodium chloride in water is about 360 g / liter at room temperature. I could not find any reputable sources claiming that this is changed by the addition of anti-caking agents. Sodium aluminosilicate is probably insoluble, depending on its exact composition (which can vary quite a bit), but that will only result in a suspension of the insoluble particles in your liquid.\n\nEdit: The question whether these substances have a \"biological effect\" is different from the headline question. Since everything you interact with will have some kind of effect, it makes more sense to limit the answer to the question of toxicity. All anti-caking agents have to be and have been approved by the appropriate agencies (FDA in the US, EFSA in Europe).\n\nFerrocyanide is a highly stable complex that does not react in the body and is excreted via feces and urine. Its use as an anti-caking agent is limited to table salt in the EU. 1 At very high concentrations it can lead to kidney damage due to crystal formation in the kidneys.

{"question": "Are there any studies that prove (or disprove) the idea of \"Six Degrees of Separation\"?", "questionId": "1825", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1825", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "Well, it just so happens that there has been an experiment done on this.  The original study was from Milgram back in the 1960s (same guy that did shock experiments).  Orginal paper can be found here: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/NetworkedLife/travers_milgram.pdf  However, the results are contentious.  A Dr. Judith Kleinfeld has a good rundown on this.  Her abstract starts out:\n\n\n  The idea that people are connected through just \"six degrees of separation,\" based on Stanley Milgram's \"small world study,\" has become part of the intellectual furniture of educated people. New evidence discovered in the Milgram papers in the Yale archives, together with a review of the literature on the \"small world problem,\" reveals that this widely-accepted idea rests on scanty evidence. Indeed, the empirical evidence suggests that we actually live in a world deeply divided by social barriers such as race and class. An explosion of interest is occurring in the small world problem because mathematicians have developed computer models of how the small world phenomenon could logically work. But mathematical modeling is not a substitute for empirical evidence. At the core of the small world problem are fascinating psychological mysteries\n\n\nShe concludes with:\n\n\n  Nothing is so useful as a good problem. The \"small world problem\" remains eternally fascinating and even more so in the digital age. Milgram has not shown that we live in a world of \"six degrees of separation.\" How we are connected to each other remains an important mystery....and a researchable one.\n\n\nI also recall watching a television program a while back where Mark Vidal of the Faber Institute distributed packages all over the world with instructions on how to get the package back to him by only sending it to people you knew (basically a repeat of the Milgram study).  I do recall that he did get his packages back, and often in less than six steps.  Although that may have been assisted for the TV show's production values.\n\nI also found this paper from Cornell (The Small-World Phenomenon: An Algorithmic Perspective) that starts out as:\n\n\n  Long a matter of folklore, the \"small-world phenomenon\" -- the principle that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances -- was inaugurated as an area of experimental study in the social sciences through the pioneering work of Stanley Milgram in the 1960's. This work was among the first to make the phenomenon quantitative, allowing people to speak of the \"six degrees of separation\" between any two people in the United States. Since then, a number of network models have been proposed as frameworks in which to study the problem analytically. One of the most refined of these models was formulated in recent work of Watts and Strogatz; their framework provided compelling evidence that the small-world phenomenon is pervasive in a range of networks arising in nature and technology, and a fundamental ingredient in the evolution of the World Wide Web. \n\n\nThis paper makes a more mathematical look at it versus an experimental look, and thus concludes:\n\n\n  Algorithmic work in different settings has considered the problem of routing with local information; see for example the problem of designing compact routing tables for communication networks [15] and the problem of robot navigation in an unknown environment 3. Our results are technically quite different from these; but they share the general goal of identifying qualitative properties of networks that makes routing with local information tractable, and offering a model for reasoning about effective routing schemes in such networks. While we have deliberately focused on a very clean model, we believe that a more general conclusion can be drawn for small-world networks: that the correlation between local structure and long-range connections provides fundamental cues for finding paths through the network. When this correlation is near a critical threshold, the structure of the long-range connections forms a type of \"gradient\" that allows individuals to guide a message efficiently toward a target. As the correlation drops below this critical value and the social network becomes more homogeneous, these cues begin to disappear; in the limit, when long-range connections are generated uniformly at random, our model describes a world in which short chains exist but individuals, faced with a disorienting array of social contacts, are unable to find them. \n\n\nI also found some further studies, however, the sites require subscriptions:\nhttp://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?nfpb=true&amp;&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ744252&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ744252\n\nSo as I started off with, the results are contentious.

The limitation for the study in 2013 showing decrease in suicides is that the analysis relied on data from a single railroad company and it did not examine the underlying suicide-mitigation mechanism of blue lights.\n\n\nIn 2014, Keio University color psychology professor Tsuneo Suzuki stated that effects have not been conclusive for research that proves that blue lights will dissuade people from killing themselves.\n\n\n\n  For instance, for a period of time, people talked about the color blue as having a calming effect on the mind. There have been attempts to test this theory, such as making running tracks blue to aid concentration, or installing blue LED lights at railway stations to prevent suicides, but the effects have not been conclusive.\n  \n  Officials from Tokyo-based private railway company Tokyu recently paid Keio University\u2019s Suzuki a visit to seek his advice about the psychological effect of colored lights. Forget about it, he said, not least because the lights would be switched off during the daylight hours. \u201cI told them that I understood their concerns but that they won\u2019t solve a deeply rooted societal problem like suicide by putting up lights,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIf you showed that it was possible, you would probably win the Nobel Prize.\u201d\n\n\nPer Kenji Hall in 2009, Tsuneo Suzuki stated,\n\n\n  Train operators are desperate to do anything that will bring down the number of suicides. But there\u2019s no research that proves that blue lights will dissuade people from killing themselves.\n\n\nAlso, East Japan Railway Company spokesman Koji Takano had said in 2009 that the decision to use blue LED lights wasn\u2019t based on any researchers\u2019 specific findings.\n\n\nA 2014 research article titled \"Reconsidering the effects of blue-light installation for prevention of railway suicides\" stated that \"The exact proportion of nighttime suicide attempts at the ends of railway platforms was not calculable. Nonetheless, the proportion of suicide attempts that is potentially preventable by blue lights should be less than our conservative estimate.\"\n\n\n\n  A recent preliminary communication suggested that the calming effect of blue lights installed at the ends of railway platforms in Japan reduced suicides by 84%. This estimate is potentially misleading from an epidemiological point of view and is reconsidered in the present study. The installation of blue lights on platforms, even were they to have some effect in preventing railway suicides at night, would have a much smaller impact than previously estimated.\n  \n  Limitations: The exact proportion of nighttime suicide attempts at the ends of railway platforms was not calculable. Nonetheless, the proportion of suicide attempts that is potentially preventable by blue lights should be less than our conservative estimate.\n\n\n\nAnother research article published in the same journal in 2014 reported no measurable increase in suicides at neighboring stations, suggesting the installation of blue streetlights did not simply inspire potentially suicidal people to seek out another platform on which to end their lives. While some limited data suggests a minor effect has been observed areas where blue streetlights have been installed, there is no documentation establishing a definitive causal connection between blue streetlights and reductions in suicide.\nPer Abimbola Farinde in 2014, seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is recognized as a type of depression that occurs in the affected population on a recurring annual basis and there has been evidence that a much less bright blue light may be all that is necessary to combat SAD.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/23859#30229", "answerId": "30229"}

{"question": "Do patients with spinal cord injury recover faster with positive attitudes?", "questionId": "5727", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5727", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "\n  The data presented in this paper confirmed the findings of the\n  literature that suggest a significant proportion of people with SCI\n  are at risk of developing negative psychological states (Elliott &amp;\n  Kennedy, 2004; Middleton et al., 2007; North, 1999). The SCI group had\n  significantly raised levels of self-reported depressive mood relative\n  to the able-bodied controls. While differences between the SCI group\n  and the controls did not reach significance for the other seven\n  measures, the SCI group had consistently higher levels of negative\n  psychological states for all measures, compared to the able-bodied\n  controls. Furthermore, people with SCI had seven times the risk of\n  having increased levels of negative psychological states typical of\n  people with a psychiatric disorder compared to the able-bodied\n  controls (20% of the SCI people had elevated levels of negative\n  psychological states). It is possible that some questionnaires (such\n  as the Beck Depression Inventory) inflate negative mood scores because\n  they contain items biased towards medical complications associated\n  with SCI (eg. items that focus on sleep, weight and physical\n  performance). However, inspection of the items in the POMS suggests\n  this is not a problem, as items require subjects to respond to 60\n  adjectives about how they feel. Therefore, the elevated POMS scores\n  associated with SCI more than likely reflect valid increases in\n  self-reported negative psychological states. This finding is somewhat\n  concerning given that the participants had been living in the\n  community on average 11 years after their injury, and were people who\n  were getting on with their lives. They were not psychologically upset\n  people recruited from hospital wards due to complications or mental\n  health problems. Clearly, the findings have implications for current\n  psychosocial strategies being used during and after rehabilitation.\n  \n  One limitation in this study was the use of only a self-report\n  questionnaire to assess psychological states. Future research\n  therefore needs to utlize a comprehensive range of assessment\n  including diagnostic clinical interviews designed to detect\n  psychopathology.  However, as stated above, the findings of this paper\n  have revealed possible challenges for current rehabilitation\n  strategies designed to counter negative psychological states. Further\n  research should assess and gather best evidence regarding treatments\n  that can reduce psychological states in SCI people during\n  rehabilitation, as this may then reduce the prevalence of negative\n  states in the long-term by assisting the person with SCI to maintain a\n  healthy mental health and adjustment (Craig et al., 1998). Potential\n  treatments include pharmacological therapies to counter\n  psychopathology such as depression, as well as non-pharmacotherapies\n  such as cognitive behavioral therapy or other psychosocial therapies\n  known to be beneficial for improving psychological status. It is\n  crucial however, that psychosocial and mental health be seen as\n  important outcomes for rehabilitation following SCI (Middleton et al.,\n  2007). \n  \n  It is also becoming clear that our knowledge about the association\n  between negative psychological states and SCI needs clarification. Ten\n  years ago rehabilitation researchers and clinicians were calling for\n  comprehensive research that could clarify the nature of the\n  psychological reaction of people to SCI (Elliott &amp; Frank, 1996;\n  Jacobs, Zachariah &amp; Bhattacharji, 1995). Unfortunately, little has\n  changed today. We need to determine the prevalence of people with SCI\n  who develop despondency or mild depressive disorder (eg. elevated\n  negative psychological states) as distinct to a major depressive\n  disorder (MDD), dysthymia or possibly adjustment disorder. We also\n  need to determine how many people with SCI develop depressive symptoms\n  due to a primary anxiety disorder such as PTSD. The influence of\n  pre-morbid psychopathological factors on psychopathology both during\n  and after rehabilitation also needs clarification. Clearly,\n  prospective research needs to be conducted to resolve the gaps in our\n  knowledge about the association between SCI and negative psychological\n  states. Such comprehensive data could well lead to an improvement  in\n  rehabilitation strategies that address the psychosocial needs of\n  people with SCI.\n  http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_12/Spinal_Cord_Injury_Craig.html\n\n\nMental health affects the physical body in many ways. A positive attitude is crucial to prevent stress and depression which again leads to more medical issues and hence complicates the recovery.\n\nLow levels of dopamine affects (one of the symptoms of depression or lack of motivation) the basal ganglia which is crucial for motor skills and learning. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20438237\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5727#5880", "answerId": "5880"}

(1 Gt = 109 tonnes = 1012 kg.) Given this level of uncertainty, it is not certain that they are growing. The global rate of mass lost from glaciers overall is closer to -500\u00b1100 Gt/y (from Jacob et al 2012), which is much greater in magnitude than the changes observed in the Himalayas.\n\n\n  Do these expanding glaciers show that there has not been any global warming?\n\n\nNo. Global warming is observed directly as the increase in surface temperature over time  (e.g. see Is the world warmer now than during the Medieval Warm Period?). The effects of global warming, including melting glaciers, do not affect conclusions whether or not the warming is actually occurring. But the global declines in ice mass are consistent with what is expected to occur in a warming world. \n\nBackground\n\nGlaciers lose mass through melting, ablation, and calving. In the popular press, the term \"melting\" is used to account for all three. Thus, saying that the glaciers are 'melting' is used as a way of saying that the amount of ice in the world - the size of the cryosphere - is decreasing. \n\nThe mass of a glacier is dynamic - it changes through time: mass is lost to melting etc. and mass is gained through precipitation of ice and snow. A nice overview of glacial dynamics is provided by the IPCC (IPCC 2007 section 4.5.1). \n\nEvidence\n\nIn section 4.5.2, The IPCC concludes that the global mass of glaciers is decreasing.

Most burning reactions in the normal atmosphere involve things burning in oxygen: it isn't obvious that the phrase \"burn oxygen\" means anything at all. This is all basic school level chemistry (so deserves a wikipedia reference). Here is the Wikipedia definition of combustion: \n\n\n  Combustion (English pronunciation: /k\u0259m\u02c8b\u028cs.t\u0283\u0259n /) or burning is the sequence of exothermic chemical reactions between a fuel and an oxidant accompanied by the production of heat and conversion of chemical species.\n\n\nThe other part of the claim that electric heaters dry the air is partially true depending on the definition of humidity. The humidity you experience is the relative humidity defined by Wikipedia as:\n\n\n  Relative humidity is defined as the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor (in a gaseous mixture of air and water vapor) to the saturated vapor pressure of water at a given temperature. In other words, relative humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air at a specific temperature compared to the maximum water vapor that the air is able to hold without it condensing, at that given temperature.\n\n\nIf air is warmed in a closed room the amount of water won't change but the relative humidity will since warm air holds more water than cold air. So the air will feel dryer. Unfortunately the question specifies absolute humidity (or the total amount of water) and just heating does nothing to the amount so the answer is no, heaters don't dry the air.\n\nBut i'm prepared to be generous and allow that electrical heaters will make air feel dryer. This is in contrast to oil or gas heaters which deplete oxygen and give off water and carbon dioxide (and some monoxide if not well maintained). In a sealed room you will eventually suffocate from lack of oxygen and presence of carbon dioxide. In a ventilated room an oil or gas heater will leave higher humidity than an electrical heater because they do release water but the electrical heater does not.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6620#6630", "answerId": "6630"}

They will take a phenomenon that the general public doesn't understand that well, and make claims that sound somewhat related to an actual benefit, and over hype it...  So going from accepted treatments, to promoting wound healing and pain relief is a bit of a stretch beyond what the established benefits of light therapy are.  Of course, the UV light a inhibit some bacterial growth in a wound, so if you are prone to getting red and inflamed wounds, it may indeed help, but not because that's the main purpose of these devices, but just aids in a process that someone may otherwise neglect (i.e. keeping wounds clean).\n\nThe claim that this helps with burns is especially dubious.  UV radiation is the main component that helps develop a sunburn.  The claim that it helps with pain management is also very dubious.  Light is absorbed by the skin, and penetrates at most only a fraction of a millimeter.  Any actual effect on deeper structures in your body is very dubious at best.\n\nI'll note they give an impressive sounding list of documents to support their claims, until you look at it more closely.

{"question": "Are cheap tea bags dangerous to your health due to high fluoride levels?", "questionId": "35494", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/35494", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "\n  Q. 1: Are the findings in the study accurately reflected in the article?\n\n\n\nThe article on Natural News: Cheap tea bags contain frighteningly high fluoride levels: Study\nThe original article about the study on Food Research International: Human exposure assessment of fluoride from tea (Camellia sinensis L.): A UK based issue?\n\n\nIn the study, they only measured the amounts of fluoride in various teas but they did not investigate any adverse effects of fluoride; they suggested that such effects could occur and referred to reliable sources. The Natural News actually presented those adverse effects in a milder way, for example, they did not mention any cancer...\n\n\n  Q. 2 and 3: Are the findings in the study corroborated by other studies, or contradicted? Is the study's methodology sound?\n\n\nOne author in Nutrition Bulletin, 2014 questioned the method used to measure fluoride in tea in said study, but he did not prove it wrong.\n\nThe researchers from Medical College of Georgia/US have found similar levels of fluoride in some black teas (Science Daily, 2010), so, the data in the UK study seems plausible.\n\nThe summary of evidence from studies:\n\n\nIn the mentioned UK (and other studies), they have found up to 9 mg fluoride per liter of some cheap teas. \nAdverse effects of excessive fluoride intake can include:\n\n\nDental fluorosis due to fluoride intake as low as 1 mg/day before age 8\nSkeletal fluorosis after fluoride intake >10 mg/day for at least 10 years\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of fluoride in tea\n\nAccording to the study in the UK, 2013:\n\n\n  Fluoride concentrations in UK tea, including the leading supermarket\n  economy labelled products, were determined. Fluoride ranged from 93 to\n  820 mg/kg in the products and 0.43 to 8.85 mg/L in the infusions.\n\n\nAmount of fluoride (in mg/liter) in various types of tea after brewing for 2 minutes in deionized (non-fluoridated) water (Table 3):\n\n\nEconomy blends (Tesco Value bags 1): 3.60-7.96   \nBlack blends (PG Tips bags): 0.76- 4.98 mg\nGreen blends (Clipper Organic leaf): 1.62-4.32   \nPure blends (Asam leaf): 0.71-2.5 mg\nOolong (Luk Yu Oolong): 0.43-1.43 mg\n\n\nThe fluoride content is highest in cheap teas, because they contain more mature tea leaves. Other black and green teas can also contain a lot of fluoride, but herbal teas usually only little.\n\nData about fluoride in teas from other studies (fluoride/liter tea):\n\n\nTibet, 2016 (from here): 2-12 mg in brick tea\nGeorgia/US, 2010 and Taiwan: 1.64-8.64 mg with highest levels in black teas\nIreland, 2016: 2.6-5.5 mg\nUSDA National Fluoride Database, 2005: 2-4 mg in black teas\nOne 2008 and 2018 study: 0.01-0.7 mg in herbal teas\n\n\nSafe fluoride intake levels\n\nAccording to The National Academies, 1997, in the US, the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for fluoride (the amount that should not cause any side effects except mild dental fluorosis) is:\n\n\n0-6 months: 0.7 mg/day\n7-12 months: 0.9 mg/day\n1-3 y: 1.3 mg/day\n4-8 y: 2.2 mg/day\n9 y and older: 10 mg/day\n\n\nDental fluorosis\n\n1) Dental fluorosis refers to yellowish discoloration of teeth due to excessive fluoride intake until age 8, but not later (The National Academies, 1997):\n\n\n  The preeruptive maturation of the crowns of the anterior permanent\n  teeth is finished and the risk of fluorosis is over by 8 years of\n  age (Fejerskov et al., 1977). Therefore, fluoride intake up to the\n  age of 8 years is of most interest. Several reports suggest that\n  enamel in the transitional or early maturation stage of development is\n  most susceptible to fluorosis, which for the anterior teeth, occurs\n  during the second and third years of life.\n\n\nand:\n\n\n  ...milder forms of enamel fluorosis affected the permanent teeth\n  of 10 to 12 percent of permanent residents in communities where\n  the drinking water had a fluoride concentration close to 1.0\n  mg/liter. The fluoride intake of children with developing teeth in\n  these communities averaged 0.05 mg/kg/day and ranged from 0.02 to 0.10\n  mg/kg/day...Mild enamel fluorosis affected about 50 percent of\n  residents where the water contained 2.0 mg/liter of fluoride. At\n  this concentration, a few cases (&lt; 5 percent) of moderate fluorosis\n  were recorded (Dean, 1942). Fluoride intake by most children in these\n  communities would have ranged from approximately 0.08 to 0.12\n  mg/kg/day. An average, chronic daily fluoride intake of 0.10 mg/kg\n  appears to be the threshold beyond which moderate enamel fluorosis\n  appears in some children. Where the water fluoride concentration was\n  4.0 mg/liter, nearly 90 percent of the residents had enamel fluorosis, and about one-half of the cases were classified as moderate or severe.\n\n\n2) Teeth with mild fluorosis appear to be more resistant to caries:\n\nFluoride and Dental Caries Prevention in Children (California Dental Association, 2014):\n\n\n  Almost all fluorosis in the United States is very mild or mild (Figure\n  4); (44) teeth with this degree of fluorosis are more resistant to\n  caries than teeth without fluorosis. More severe dental fluorosis,\n  which manifests as enamel pitting and predisposition to staining\n  (Figure 3D), is unusual in the United States but occurs in other parts\n  of the world where there are naturally high levels of fluoride in the\n  water (eg, >2 ppm). Teeth with severe fluorosis are paradoxically\n  more susceptible to caries.\n\n\n3) In one small 1996 study in Tibet, more than 50% of children who have consumed about 5.5 mg fluoride/day, mainly by brick tea, had dental fluorosis.\n\nSkeletal fluorosis\n\nSkeletal fluorosis refers to skeletal pain and deformities due to increased bone mass caused by high fluoride intake. According to The National Academies, 1997:\n\n\n  an intake of at least 10 mg/day for 10 or more years is needed to\n  produce clinical signs of the milder forms of the condition.\n\n\n1) The article Skeletal fluorosis and instant tea (The American Journal of Medicine, 2005) describes a case of a 52-years-old woman who developed skeletal fluorosis after drinking 1-2 gallons (4-8 liters) of instant tea prepared with fluoridated water for about 30 years (estimated fluoride intake: 37 to 74 mg/day). \n\n2) In another article: Skeletal Fluorosis From Instant Tea (The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 2009), a 49-year-old woman, who was drinking 2 gallons (~8 liters) of instant tea with 5.8 mg fluoride/liter from age 12 (estimated fluoride intake: 44 mg/day.) has developed skeletal fluorosis.\n\n3) In a study in Tibet/China: Brick tea fluoride as a main source of adult fluorosis, Food and Chemical Toxicology, 2003, most adults who were habitually drinking \"brick tea\" (average fluoride intake: 12 mg/day) had some skeletal changes (osteosclerosis, osteoporosis, arthritis).\n\n4) In another study in Tibet Prevalence of Brick Tea-Type Fluorosis in the Tibet Autonomous Region (Journal of Epidemiology, 2016), 18-84 % of adults who were regularly drinking brick tea had skeletal fluorosis.\n\nHypothyroidism\n\nIn the studies in Saudi Arabia, 2010, the UK, 2012/13, Ireland, 2016, Canada, 2018, India, 2018 and Iran, 2018 they have observed an association between modest fluoride intake by tea and fluoridated water and hypothyroidism, especially in the individuals with iodine deficiency, but more research is warranted.\n\nCancer\n\nI have found no studies about fluoride in tea and cancer, but according to Agency of Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2013, there is no association between high fluoride intake from water and cancer:\n\n\n  Most of the studies of people living in areas with fluoridated water\n  or naturally high levels of fluoride in drinking water did not find an\n  association between fluoride and cancer risk.\n\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n\nDental fluorosis (yellow discoloration of permanent teeth) can develop in children under age 8 who regularly drink tea with as little as 1 mg fluoride/liter. Mild fluorosis decreases, but severe fluorosis (>2 mg fluoride/day) increases the risk of caries.\nSkeletal fluorosis (increased bone density with skeletal pain or deformities) can develop in adults who start to drink tea as children or adults and consume at least 10 mg fluoride/day (for example 2 liters of tea with 5 mg fluoride/liter) for at least 10 years. Drinking 1 liter of tea with the highest fluoride level in the UK study (8 mg/liter) should not have any side effects in adults. Skeletal fluorosis in the US and UK is extremely rare.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/35494#45468", "answerId": "45468"}

{"question": "Do beef farmed pastures net remove carbon emissions?", "questionId": "44684", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/44684", "category": "climate-change", "categoryId": 1, "answer": "No.\n\nThis is not really an infographic that is truthful. It is 'anecdotal evidence' evidence for one farm, very probably not true for that very farm, and in any case a misleading oversimplification.\n\nPasture land can sequester some carbon, yes, but how meaningful is that? Carbon is just the element, and the element is not a greenhouse gas (GHG). Carbon dioxide is a GHG, and yes, green pastures do capture some CO2. But even if true that 112 tons of carbon gas is emitted and 500 tons sequestered annually, what does that translate to in practice if 500 tons of CO2 are captured but 112 tons of methane released? \n\nFor global warming climate change that would be a huge problem as methane is much more warming than CO2. Up to 34 times worse over a 100 year period. It also leaves out other gasses like N2O that are also a bigger problem than CO2. With that line of reasoning one could also argue that killing and eating a cow stops it from producing methane and thus the animal meat eaten by humans is saving the planet!\n\n\n  However, emissions from livestock respiration are part of a rapidly cycling biological system, where the plant matter consumed was itself created through the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds. \n  \n  Since the emitted and absorbed quantities are considered to be equivalent, livestock respiration is not considered to be a net source under the Kyoto Protocol. Indeed, since part of the carbon consumed is stored in the live tissue of the growing animal, a growing global herd could even be considered a carbon sink. The standing stock livestock biomass increased significantly over the last decades (from about 428 million tonnes in 1961 to around 699 million tonnes in 2002). This continuing growth (see Chapter 1) could be considered as a carbon sequestration process (roughly estimated at 1 or 2 million tonnes carbon per year). However, this is more than offset by methane emissions which have increased correspondingly.  \n  \n  The equilibrium of the biological cycle is, however, disrupted in the case of overgrazing or bad management of feedcrops. The resulting land degradation is a sign of decreasing re-absorption of atmospheric CO2 by vegetation re-growth. In certain regions the related net CO2 loss may be significant.     \n  \n  Methane released from enteric fermentation may total 86 million tonnes per year. Globally, livestock are the most important source of anthropogenic methane emissions.\n  \n  In the United States methane from enteric fermentation totalled 5.5 million tonnes in 2002, again overwhelmingly originating from beef and dairy cattle. This was 71 percent of all agricultural emissions and 19 percent of the country\u2019s total emissions (US-EPA, 2004).\n   \u2013\u2013   Food and Agriculture Organization of The United Nations: \"Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues And Options\", Rome, 2006. \n\n\nOf course, the picture alludes to how coal and oil got into the ground in the first place. Plants and animals are carbon based, when they died and were buried deep enough without immediate decomposition/recycling by other lifeforms the were effectively sequestering carbon out of the atmosphere. \n\nThe reality looks a bit different for current farming practices. Only careful management in a less than now common in industrialised intensive farming has the potential to be less damaging for the atmosphere. The style and sheer amount of Western capitalist agroculture for cattle raising has to be reduced or changed significantly otherwise, as no farming practice that conforms to current market demands complies with reducing GHG emmissions. \n\nThe US Natural Resources Conservation Service currently advises a rule of thumb that 1 cow needs 2 acres to be fed with grass for a year.\n\n\n  The daily utilization rate for livestock. This is always the same number, .04, or 4%. This figure is used because livestock need to have 4% of their weight in forage each day (2.5- 3% intake, .5 trampling loss and .5-1% buffer). (PDF)\n\n\nWith 130 animals on the example from the claim, that farm is already quite crowded and it will damage the pasture if it is not extremely productive and resilient or other fodder than grass is provided into the mix. Since that's left out from the picture, the numbers are already skewed.\n\nThis effect isn't really news:\n\n\n  Overgrazing of pasturelands is one of the major problems facing the Oklahoma farmer today. Aside from soil erosion on cultivated land, excessive pasturing of prairie and woodland is perhaps our greatest agricultural menace. Greater runoff from grazing land as the vegetation is destroyed added to water lost from tilled soil has increased the flood problem not only in Oklahoma but throughout the country.\n  \u2013\u2013 Charles Clinton Smith: \"The Effect of Overgrazing and Erosion Upon the Biota of the Mixed-Grass Prairie of Oklahoma\", Ecology, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Jul., 1940), pp. 381-397.\n\n\nThe USDA has calculated the effect of reconversion from crop fields to grasslands in the most optimal conditions on highly productive land in the North-Eastern US. These calculations should indicate that the numbers used in the claim are most probable what on Skeptics constitutes original research' that unfortunately erred along the way:\n\n\n  Decades of plowing have depleted organic C stocks in many agricultural soils. Conversion of plowed fields to pasture has the potential to reverse this process, recapturing organic matter that was lost under more intensive cropping systems. Temperate pastures in the northeast USA are highly productive and could act as significant C sinks. However, such pastures have relatively high biomass removal as hay or through consumption by grazing animals. In addition, the ability to sequester C decreases over time as previously depleted stocks are replenished and the soil returns to equilibrium conditions.  The objective of this research was to use eddy covariance systems to quantify CO2 fluxes over two fields in central Pennsylvania that had been managed as pastures for at least 35 yr. Net ecosystem exchange measurements averaged over 8 site-years suggested that the pastures were acting as small net C sinks of 19 g C m\u22122 yr\u22121 (positive values indicate uptake). However, when biomass removal and manure deposition were included to calculate net biome productivity, the pastures were a net source of \u221281 g C m\u22122 yr\u22121 (negative values indicate loss to the atmosphere). Manure generated from the hay that was consumed off site averaged 18 g C m\u22122 yr\u22121. Returning that manure to the pastures would have only partially replenished the lost C, and the pastures would have remained net C sources. Heavy use of the biomass produced on these mature pastures prevented them from acting as C sinks.\n  \u2013\u2013 R. Howard Skinner (USDA-ARS): \"High Biomass Removal Limits Carbon Sequestration Potential of Mature Temperate Pastures\", Journal of Environmental Quality, July 2008. \n\n\nAnd even in scientific studies arguing for re-calculating the CO2-sink effect of grasslands has to admit:\n\n\n  Grazing pressure is a factor that affects C sequestration although it was not included in this study. ...\n   This question does not have a simple answer if we consider that our study was focused on a regional scale. It is clear that C losses may be high in grazing areas of high cattle density. Intensive and frequent grazing imposes an increased C removal from roots to allow subsequent vegetation regrowth. For example, a meta-analysis investigation (Zhou et al., 2017) that comprised 115 cases suggests an additional carbon loss due to intensive grazing of about 21%. Very high stocking rates (N4\u20135 heads/ha) explain such losses. ...\n  Although animal densities were heterogeneously distributed [...] in this study we assumed that those densities were low enough to prevent any significant loss of belowground C. So, we desisted from applying any uncertain coefficient to account for carbon losses due to grazing intensity. ...\n  Change of C stock due to land conversion was not specifically consid- ered in this research methods, but some aspects deserve a comment. There is meaningful question that has not still been completely an- swered. Do forests always sequester more C than grasslands as IPCC guidelines assumed? In a global meta-analysis that involved 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics Don et al. (2010) tend to confirm this assumption.\n   They showed that the highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (\u221225%) and perennial crops (\u221230%), and forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12%. ...\n  Although management practices were not analyzed in this study, in line with scientific evidence (Conant et al., 2017) we also believe that management is a factor that can significantly improve carbon sequestra- tion. But provided that our knowledge about how grazing lands are managed in different sites of world is limited, we have to accept that figures on C sequestration due to management interventions remain uncertain (Smith et al., 2007).\n   \u2013\u2013 E.F. Viglizzo et al.: \"Reassessing the role of grazing lands in carbon-balance estimations: Meta-analysis and review\", Science of the Total Environment,  661 (2019) 531\u2013542. \n\n\nCattle raising currently and globally emits much more than it captures in the long run. Only grass fed beef can be sustainable in the sense of 'less damaging'; and only on suitable land that is not forested now. As soon as you feed grains to cattle in mass the calculation fails. And the optimistic calculation from the claim only could work if the pasture would be growing topsoil with carbon incorporated into it in more stable forms. When organic matter recycling, or erosion and other forms of topsoil loss enter the picture, again, the calculation fails.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Cattle dominate livestock related emissions, contributing around 65% of the total, buffaloes and small ruminants add a further 9% and 7% respectively, so in all ruminants account for over 80% of total livestock related climate impacts, most significantly via enteric methane (Figure 3) \u2013 which are highest, per unit of milk or meat, in grazing systems. Other studies give broadly comparable estimates. This 80% share of GHG emissions is worth setting against the 50% that ruminants contribute to overall terrestrial animal product protein supply (Figure 3). Grazing systems specifically emit an estimated 1.32 Gt CO2-eq (a figure that includes land use change-related impacts), which is about 20% of all emissions from livestock.   \n  \n  \n  Soils are very significant carbon stores. All soils contain carbon although different soil types differ in how much they contain. Above ground biomass also stores carbon \u2013 especially trees.\n  As plants grow they draw down carbon from the atmosphere, apportioning some into their roots. Much of this is released back to the atmosphere when plants die and decompose. But, if left undisturbed, some of the carbon in their roots and in plant litter \u2013 depending on climate, rainfall, the soil microbial community, management and many other variables \u2013 may eventually be incorporated into more stable compounds in the soil, constituting a net removal of carbon from the atmosphere. This is soil carbon sequestration.\n  If favourable conditions continue, soils sequester carbon until equilibrium is reached, after which emissions and removals are balanced and no more is sequestered. Further increases in sequestration may be possible if there is a change in how the land is used or managed.\n  Sufficient nitrogen needs to be available for plants to grow and therefore for soils to sequester carbon. This can be provided in the form of bacterial nitrogen  fixation, such as that associated with the roots of legumes, application of mineral fertilisers or organic amendments containing nitrogen, but higher nitrous oxide emissions may outweigh sequestration gains.\n  Since sequestration is time-limited, so too is its role in mitigation efforts. There are additional problems of reversibility (what can be done can be undone) and leakage (organic amendments applied on one area of land may be at the cost of its previous application elsewhere). Legacy effects of past management practices also need recognising to avoid drawing false conclusions about the effects of the current management regime.\n  Grazing animals potentially aid the process of sequestration as their consumption of herbage stimulates plant growth and leads to the partitioning of and increase in organic matter below ground.\n  Factors including soil type and quality, climate and seasonal variability, precipition levels, nutrient availability, composition of soil fauna and microbial communities, and vegetation type will influence whether organic matter is converted into stable below ground carbon which determines if sequestration actually occurs.\n  In many parts of the world the potential for grazing management to achieve sequestration is limited or absent.\n  Heavy grazing is a problem on many grazing lands: by reducing plant growth, it causes carbon losses from the system.\n  Evidence as to the sequestration benefits of holistic, adaptive and other variants of rotational grazing is patchy and highly contradictory. Where there are benefits, these are small.\n  The highly ambitious claims made about the potential for holistic grazing to mitigate climate change are wrong.\n  The sequestration potential from grazing management is between 295\u2013800 Mt CO2-eq/year: this offsets only 20-60% of annual average emissions from the grazing ruminant sector, and makes a negligible dent on overall livestock emissions.\n  Expansion or intensification in the grazing sector as an approach to sequestering more carbon would lead to substantial increases in methane, nitrous oxide and land use change-induced CO2 emissions...\n  Practices that are optimal for achieving soil carbon sequestration may not be so for other environmental goals, such as biodiversity conservation.\n  Leaving aside any scope for sequestration it is imperative that we \u2018keep carbon in the ground\u2019: by acting to halt degradation or conversion to croplands to avoid losing the huge carbon stocks already stored in grasslands.\n  \n  \n   \u2013\u2013 Tara Garnett, Ce\u0301cile Godde et al.: \"Grazed and confused? \u2013 Ruminating on cattle, grazing systems, methane, nitrous oxide, the soil carbon sequestration question \u2013 and what it all means for greenhouse gas emissions\", Food Climate Research Network, Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, 2017. (PDF) \n\n\n\n\nAs the above might read 'a bit too anti-beef': \nIt might be noteworthy to emphasise  the last point from the last quote: cattle production as such is not the devil, and that for ensuring human nutrition converting grassland to intensive agriculture annual crops with tilled bare soil and ample fertiliser and pesticide usage is actually worse, carbon-wise, as it contributes a massive carbon loss in the soil organic matter under ideal conditions and facilitates erosion and thus total top-soil loss and huge carbon emissions. Just planting maize monocultures instead of raising cattle doesn't solve anything.\n\n\n  The conversion of grasslands to arable use has led to a 25\u201343% decline in soil carbon stocks in the uppermost 120 cm in the USA, as compared to native grassland (Potter et al. 2000). A well documented chronosequence in France has yielded similar results (Boiffin &amp; Fleury 1974).

There really isn't a\n  problem, if done properly. The greatest hazard is allowing the fat to\n  become rancid (spoiled) and deteriorated to the point it produces\n  undesirable flavors and odors. Besides ruining what would have been a\n  perfectly good meal, rancid oils also contain free radicals that are\n  potentially carcinogenic.\n\n\nHowever that entry is from 2002. Since then there have been studies that indicate the re-use of cooking oils can have detrimental effects on health:\n\n\n  Experts say that different types of cooking oils are better for you\n  than others, and a new study suggests that the number of times you\n  reuse cooking oils can also affect your health.\n  \n  Spanish researchers found that people whose kitchens contained any\n  type of oil that had been reused many times over were more likely to\n  have high blood pressure than people whose cooking oils were changed\n  more frequently.\n\n\nThat text is quoted from a Reuters Health story which is no longer accessable, although it has been reprinted on many sites, such as this one.\n\nA link to the study\n\nA separate study in 2005 found that a toxin called 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) forms when cooking oils are reheated and has been associated with increased risks of stroke, Alzheimers, Huntingtons disease and other health problems.\n\nQuoting from the study:\n\n\n  Previous investigations in this laboratory showed that HNE is formed\n  in thermally oxidized soybean oil, which is high in linoleic acid.\n  Continuous exposure of the oil to frying temperature (185\u00b0C) for up to\n  6 h graduallyincreased the formation of HNE and other polar lipophilic\n  aldehydes. Additional investigations in this laboratory showed that\n  HNE is absorbed into food fried in thermally oxidized oil in the same\n  concentration as was found in the oil.\n\n\nSo, there is evidence that re-heating cooking oils can have a negative health impact. It is unclear to what extent the impact would be on humans at this stage. Given that the study experiments continuously heated the oil for an extended period, re-using cooking oil once or twice is probably OK.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8461#8463", "answerId": "8463"}

From the abstract:\n\n\n  Conclusions As with many interventions intended to prevent ill health, the effectiveness of parachutes has not been subjected to rigorous evaluation by using randomised controlled trials. Advocates of evidence based medicine have criticised the adoption of interventions evaluated by using only observational data. We think that everyone might benefit if the most radical protagonists of evidence based medicine organised and participated in a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial of the parachute.\n\n\nA discussion follows and I'm content with this comment that addresses the absurdity of demanding an explicit medical answer: \n\n\n  Not the common sense but simple laws of physics can prove the effectiveness of the parachute as a life saving intervention. When a person jumps from a height accelerates towards the earth and eventually reaches the \u201cterminal velocity\u201d. For an average person this terminal velocity is about 200km/hour and it takes only about 3 seconds to reach the terminal velocity. The damages caused to an individual hitting the ground at this speed is not just broken arms! Now, introducing a parachute reduces this terminal velocity to less than 10km/hour. This is comparable to crashing an old car without any airbags to a solid concrete wall at 200km/h and 10km/h.\n\n\nAccording to Wikipedia (and other sources) the Guiness world record for falling without a parachute belongs to Vesna Vulovic\u0301 who fell 10,000m, with several more people falling over 5,000m during WWII. The Wikipedia article also references a pub med article Ten years of experience with falls from a height in children. that states\n\n\n  Falls from a height are a major cause of accidental death in urban children. The medical and social data on 61 children admitted over the last decade for falls of one or more stories were reviewed. Seventy-seven percent of the children survived. Of the children who fell three stories or less, all survived (100%). Fifty percent mortality occurred between the fifth and sixth floors. Seventy-seven percent of the falls were accidental and 23% of the children jumped or were pushed. The 96% decrease in accidental falls from windows since 1979 demonstrates that the \"Children Can't Fly\" program in New York City has almost eliminated accidental falls from windows in our hospital population.\n\n\nThere are countless of articles about the injury rate of parachuting and base jumping that all give about the same numbers. Parachuting injuries: a study of 110,000 sports jumps from 1987 states:\n\n\n  A total of 110,000 parachute jumps resulted in six (0.005%) fatalities and 155 (0.14%)\n  cases, requiring medical treatment. The latter group sustained 176 injuries of which 36.9% were significant soft tissue lesions and 63.1% fractures. Landing is the most dangerous part of the parachuting procedure, causing 83.8% of the accidents, while 9.3% were caused by faults during opening of the parachute.\n\n\nOn the age of those that participated it states:\n\n\n  The mean age was 29.3 years, range 16-62 years.\n\n\nWorking with the assumption that survivability doesn't increase with falling distance, and that age doesn't profoundly diminish the damage cause to humans by rapid deceleration, we must conclude that it's the parachutes responsible for the increase in survivability from 50% when falling from the fifth to sixth floor to 99.995% when jumping out of an airplane.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIs the use of parachutes supported by peer-reviewed papers?\n\nYes, there are many papers that that show that parachutes are being used.\n\nDoes the literature show that parachuting increases survivability over free-falling?\n\nYes, indirectly.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1064#1066", "answerId": "1066"}

I also looked at the journal's impact metrics; junk journals tend to score very low on these metrics.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: Junk Journals: Of the papers I reviewed, only two were clearly from a junk journal. Nikolov and Zeller, 2017 and Allmendinge, 2017 were both published in Environment Pollution and Climate Change. This journal released its first issue in Spring of 2017 and has some of the of the hallmarks of a predatory open-access journal; low publishing fees, articles submitted by email, and a messy website. I do not believe that articles submitted to this journal go through proper peer review. They should not be considered real scientific work.\n\nBy contrast, all of the other publications had professional websites, had been operating for a long time, and have clear citation statistics (measurements of scientific impact).\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: Explicit criticism of mainstream climate science. Other than the two papers discussed above, only one other paper, Harde 2017, explicitly criticizes mainstream climate science in the abstract, conclusions, or other parts that I skimmed. There may be other explicit criticisms that were buried in the body of the paper. Harde thinks that CO2 will leave the atmosphere quicker than the IPCC estimates.\n\nThis one paper levels a substantive criticism at mainstream climate science.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: Does the paper contradict fundamental pieces of climate science?\n\nDo the 9 remaining papers present fundamental contradictions to mainstream climate science?\n\nSeven of the papers focus on climate from hundreds or thousands of years ago. ( Yan et al., 2017,Li et al., 2017,Woodson et al., 2017,Lachniet et al., 2017,Kitaba et al., 2017,Schaltegger et al. Huhtamaa and Helama, 2017 ) They use data taken from rocks, ice cores, or other things that last for thousands of years. These papers generally do not have any data in the past 50 to 100 years, and therefore have very little to say about anthropogenic climate change. They are useful for understanding natural things that affect the climate, like changes in solar irradiance, volcanoes, and the Earth's magnetic field. \n\nFor example Lachniet et al. used data from \"fast-growing stalagmites\" to study monsoon cycles in Central America. Because their data is from between 1900 and 30 years ago, only one of their data points can actually be used to look at modern climate change. One of their conclusions is that other people who have made climate models of Central American rainfall are improperly leaving out the effects of the El-Nino cycle. They explicitly say that \"long-lived greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere\" affect the El-nino cycle, which itself has a large impact on rainfall. Nothing this paper says really casts doubt on the broad conclusions of climate science.\n\n3 papers looked at the effect of solar forcing on climate. Solar forcing refers to the changes in climate due to fluctuations in how much light Earth gets from the sun. (Li et al.,Yndestad and Solheim, 2017,Li et al) Solar forcing is fairly well known, and precisely modeling it will allow climate scientists to better model climate overall. Once again, these papers are building up the scientific understanding of the specifics of climate, not tearing it down. (Some of these papers are also about climate from thousands of years ago.)\n\nStenhouse et al. surveyed American Meteorological Society members about their views on climate change. 63% said that climate was either half or mostly caused by humans. The main conclusion of this paper was that many climate scientists are sick of all of the arguing. This paper isn't really evidence for or against climate change. Climate doesn't care about our opinions and beliefs.\n\nWhile skimming through these papers I do see a normal level of skepticism and doubt. The scientists criticize other scientists models. Saying they are too conservative, or underestimate the impact of variable X on variable Y. Nowhere do I see them trying to say that climate change science is all wrong.\n\n\n\nSnopes Answer: \nAfter I wrote the above answer, Snopes published a review of a Breitbart article which was based on the above post. Snopes came to largely the same conclusions, and were able to get quotes from some of the actual scientists whose papers were being misrepresented. These scientists believe that their work is being misrepresented by these bloggers. \n\nFor example, quoting Jessica Conroy (link to paper):\n\n\n  I do not agree with Breitbart's assessment of my work. My paper does not discuss 20th century anthropogenic warming trends, but decadal to centennial variability in the monsoon precipitation of the southern Tibetan Plateau.\n\n\n...and quoting Erica Rosenblum (link to paper):\n\n\n  Our paper certainly does not say that \u201cglobal warming is a myth\u201d... Our main results showed that the models appear to be too conservative and simulate Arctic sea ice that is not sensitive enough to changes in global temperatures.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/39822#39832", "answerId": "39832"}

Recorded gas temperatures near the ceiling are reported as high as 1350  C [21], and mean temperatures over the peak burning period are 1000 to 1200  C for polyethylene fires [21] and approximately 900 to 1200  C for wood cribs [20].

As the fire diameter increases, the radiative fraction falls due to soot blockage [25]. Fig. 4 shows flame temperature data for turbulent plumes as a function of Xr. The extrapolated adiabatic temperature is approximately 1500  C. For a realistic adiabatic flame temperature of 2000  C, the actual turbulent mixing factor is approximately 0.75 or a turbulent dilution factor of 1.5.

First of all, the entire question of climate change has been addressed here quite throughly.  Several times in fact.  With several of the canards addressed as well. Those repeatedly as well.\n\nThe term scientist can be applied to anyone with a Bachelor of Science degree (a fact that has been abused before, see below).  The article states that these scientists are (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  Claude Allegre, former director of the Institute for the Study of the Earth, University of Paris; J. Scott Armstrong, cofounder of the Journal of Forecasting and the International Journal of Forecasting; Jan Breslow, head of the Laboratory of Biochemical Genetics and Metabolism, Rockefeller University; Roger Cohen, fellow, American Physical Society; Edward David, member, National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Sciences; William Happer, professor of physics, Princeton; Michael Kelly, professor of technology, University of Cambridge, U.K.; William Kininmonth, former head of climate research at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology; Richard Lindzen, professor of atmospheric sciences, MIT; James McGrath, professor of chemistry, Virginia Technical University; Rodney Nichols, former president and CEO of the New York Academy of Sciences; Burt Rutan, aerospace engineer, designer of Voyager and SpaceShipOne; Harrison H.

And again, just because an incredibly small number of scientists disagree on a subject and have the capital and clout to publish in a major newspaper does not lend any particular veracity to their claim.  And since there are indeed a large number of climate scientists (by some estimates, 30,000 in the US alone), and that worldwide 97-98% agree with humans causing global climate change, I am surprised that the Wall Street Journal went with such a weak list.  This seems to be an extension of the previous dissent list that was debunked.\n\n\n  In fact, OISM signatories represent a tiny fraction (~0.3%) of all US science graduates (petition cards were only sent to individuals within the U.S)\n  \n  According to figures from the US Department of Education Digest of Education Statistics: 2008, 10.6 million science graduates have gained qualifications consistent with the OISM polling criteria since the 1970-71 school year. 32,000 out of 10 million is not a very compelling figure, but a tiny minority - approximately 0.3 per cent.\n\n\nIf anything, this article, along with all the dissent seems to be just the same as Project Steve instead of true scientific dissent.  This is more sophistry to muddy an issue that has firm evidence supporting it, and people are attempting to play politics with science.  The United States seems to be the worst nation on the earth for this type of manufactroversy.\n\nI know it's a wikipedia link, however they are reporting just statements that are in the public record.  The important thing to note is that these are statements of consensus from these organizations.\n\n\n  A question that frequently arises in popular discussion of climate change is whether there is a scientific consensus on climate change. Several scientific organizations have explicitly used the term \"consensus\" in their statements\n  \n  American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2006: \"The conclusions in this statement reflect the scientific consensus represented by, for example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the Joint National Academies' statement.\"\n  \n  US National Academy of Sciences: \"In the judgment of most climate scientists, Earth\u2019s warming in recent decades has been caused primarily by human activities that have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. ... On climate change, [the National Academies\u2019 reports] have assessed consensus findings on the science...\"\n  \n  Joint Science Academies' statement, 2005: \"We recognise the international scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\"\n  \n  Joint Science Academies' statement, 2001: \"The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change science. We recognise IPCC as the world\u2019s most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes, and we endorse its method of achieving this consensus.\"\n  \n  American Meteorological Society, 2003: \"The nature of science is such that there is rarely total agreement among scientists. Individual scientific statements and papers\u2014the validity of some of which has yet to be assessed adequately\u2014can be exploited in the policy debate and can leave the impression that the scientific community is sharply divided on issues where there is, in reality, a strong scientific consensus.... IPCC assessment reports are prepared at approximately five-year intervals by a large international group of experts who represent the broad range of expertise and perspectives relevant to the issues. The reports strive to reflect a consensus evaluation of the results of the full body of peer-reviewed research.... They provide an analysis of what is known and not known, the degree of consensus, and some indication of the degree of confidence that can be placed on the various statements and conclusions.\"\n  \n  Network of African Science Academies: \u201cA consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change.\u201d\n  \n  International Union for Quaternary Research, 2008: \"INQUA recognizes the international scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\"\n  \n  Australian Coral Reef Society, 2006: \"There is almost total consensus among experts that the earth\u2019s climate is changing as a result of the build-up of greenhouse gases.... There is broad scientific consensus that coral reefs are heavily affected by the activities of man and there are significant global influences that can make reefs more vulnerable such as global warming....\"\n\n\nThe important thing to take away is that just because a few people have a loud platform for their appeals does not lend any greater credibility to their agendas.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/7722#7725", "answerId": "7725"}

Online forums are a trigger for suicide. Any online forum\n\nProtecting Teens from the Spread of Suicide\n\n\n  Although we don\u2019t usually think of suicide as contagious, one of the strongest predictors of suicide in youth is the suicide or suicide attempt of a friend or family member (Juhnke, Granello, &amp; Haag-Granello, 2011; Mayer, 2013). Teens exposed to suicide are at significantly higher risk of suicide over the next two years (Mayer, 2013). Exposure to suicide in online forums (Dunlop, More, &amp; Romer, 2011) and through YouTube videos about suicide fuels self-destructive fantasy and also increases suicide risk.\n  \n  Recommendations include refraining from giving details or images of the method or place where the victim was found (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1994; Sudak &amp; Sudak, 2005). Care should be taken not to focus on the immediate external precipitant as the cause of the suicide (e.g., a break-up) or other situations to which teens can easily relate (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1994; Mayer, 2013). Doing so increases identification with the victim and can inadvertently convey that suicide could also be a solution to their problems. Another danger is allowing memorializing to go too far, feeding into teen idealization of death and suicide (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1994; Sudak &amp; Sudak, 2005).\n\n\nWhere do youth learn about suicides on the Internet, and what influence does this have on suicidal ideation?\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21658185\n\n\n  While traditional sources of information about suicide were most often cited (79% were from friends and family or newspapers), online sources were also quite common (59%). Social networking sites were frequently cited as sources, but these reports were not linked to increases in ideation. However, online discussion forums [any forum] were both cited as sources and associated with increases in ideation.\n\n\nAlso the internet is sometimes used by people who are already planning a suicide to help them learn to commit suicide more effectively-more lethally. Any question about the methods of suicide would be of interest to this group.\n\nParasuicide online: Can suicide websites trigger suicidal behaviour in predisposed adolescents?\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15204216\n\n\n  The present case report describes a 17-year-old female who explicitly visited suicide web forums, where she researched reliable suicide methods, contacted an anonymous user and purchased substances for the implementation of suicide.\n\n\nModerators of these websites specifically are avoiding situations such as this. \n\nI was wrong in the comments. These studies have been replicated many times. See this.\n\nAlthough this research has been centered on teen suicide, it is likely also an important factor for older age groups who have strong engagement with the internet as well. \n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/20373#20375", "answerId": "20375"}
{"question": "Does the radioactivity on Hiroshima's soil affect radiometric dating?", "questionId": "9663", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9663", "category": "physics", "categoryId": 3, "answer": "In the comments, Gary Kindel, pointed out, \"Just answer the question and stop worrying who is going to use to support a specific dating technique.\" \n\nSo the short answer is yes, radioactivity can and does affect radiometric dating techniques. This is a well established phenomenon and as such, there are many other dating methods that make up for this.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of different radiometric dating methods, based on different elements (Uranium Lead, Potassium Argon, Uranium Thorium, Carbon, Chlorine-36, Luminescence, Samarium-neodymium, Rubidium Strontium and more.) \n\nCreationists usually point to carbon dating, carbon 14 decay dating. Carbon dating, like other radiometric dating relies on a fairly constant decay over time. Since the creation of carbon 14 varies slightly due to things like volcano eruptions, a calibration curve can be used to adjust it. Results that use a calibration adjustment are called Calibrated or Cambridge Dates. These dates are usually expressed in regular calender dates. As apposed to Uncalibrated or Libby Dates, that use the BP (before present) date. \n\nScience\n\n\n  Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon, with a half-life of\n  5,730 years,[23][24] which is very short compared with the above\n  isotopes. In other radiometric dating methods, the heavy parent\n  isotopes were produced by nucleosynthesis in supernovas, meaning that\n  any parent isotope with a short half-life should be extinct by now.\n  Carbon-14, though, is continuously created through collisions of\n  neutrons generated by cosmic rays with nitrogen in the upper\n  atmosphere and thus remains at a near-constant level on Earth. The\n  carbon-14 ends up as a trace component in atmospheric carbon dioxide\n  (CO2).\n  \n  An organism acquires carbon during its lifetime. Plants acquire it\n  through photosynthesis, and animals acquire it from consumption of\n  plants and other animals. When an organism dies, it ceases to take in\n  new carbon-14, and the existing isotope decays with a characteristic\n  half-life (5730 years). The proportion of carbon-14 left when the\n  remains of the organism are examined provides an indication of the\n  time elapsed since its death. The carbon-14 dating limit lies around\n  58,000 to 62,000 years\n  \n  The rate of creation of carbon-14 appears to be roughly constant, as\n  cross-checks of carbon-14 dating with other dating methods show it\n  gives consistent results. However, local eruptions of volcanoes or\n  other events that give off large amounts of carbon dioxide can reduce\n  local concentrations of carbon-14 and give inaccurate dates. The\n  releases of carbon dioxide into the biosphere as a consequence of\n  industrialization have also depressed the proportion of carbon-14 by a\n  few percent; conversely, the amount of carbon-14 was increased by\n  above-ground nuclear bomb tests that were conducted into the early\n  1960s. Also, an increase in the solar wind or the Earth's magnetic\n  field above the current value would depress the amount of carbon-14\n  created in the atmosphere. These effects are corrected for by the\n  calibration of the radiocarbon dating scale.\n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating#Radiocarbon_dating_method\n\n\nNuclear carbon dating is not the only test used to date fossils. There many other dating methods that are used to date things; one of witch is chemical properties of igneous rock formations. Others are thermoluminescence, amino acid, etc.\n\nTo answer your question, nuclear weapons testing brought about a reaction that simulated atmospheric production of carbon 14 in unnatural quantities. The huge thermal neutron flux produced by nuclear bombs reacted with nitrogen atoms present in the atmosphere to form carbon 14. The carbon 14 produced is what is known as bomb carbon or artificial radiocarbon. Nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s have nearly doubled the atmospheric carbon 14 content as measured in around 1965.\n\nThe level of bomb carbon was about 100% above normal levels between 1963 and 1965. The level of bomb carbon in the northern hemisphere reached a peak in 1963, and in the southern hemisphere around 1965.\n\nSee this graph, and description below.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Radiocarbon_bomb_spike.svg\n\nOne of the main methods used to date fossils is by the strata they are found in. Some strata are dated absolutely via radiometric dating. These methods are sufficient to determine a great deal of stratigraphy. \n\nSome fossils are seen to occur only in certain strata (like dinosaurs.) Such fossils can be used as index fossils. When these fossils exist, they can be used to determine the age of the strata, because the fossils show that the strata correspond to strata that have already been dated by other means. \n\nFor more information on radiometric dating, read Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale, Circular Reasoning or Reliable Tools? By Andrew MacRae.\n\n\n  Given that the half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years, one can calculate\n  that 4 billion C-14 atoms will produce 1 decay per minute on the\n  average. Converting the 4 billion atoms to grams (a nickel weighs 5\n  grams), we get 0.000000000000093 grams of carbon-14. Consequently, by\n  tallying one click per minute on the Geiger counter, we can measure a\n  whole lot further than 7 decimal places!\n  \n  A 1-gram, fresh sample of carbon, containing the atmospheric\n  concentration of one ten-billionth percent of carbon-14, will yield\n  about 12 decays per minute. That figure follows directly from the\n  mathematics and, as the atmospheric portion of carbon-14 given above\n  is an approximation, is close enough to Dr. Hovind's present-day\n  figure of 16 counts per minute per gram. Because of atomic bomb tests,\n  the rate is slightly higher today, but the present rate would not\n  apply to animals and plants which died before such tests. One book\n  used a figure of about 13.5 decays per minute per gram for the\n  pre-bomb rate. Consequently, a 64-gram sample of fresh carbon will\n  still give about 7 clicks per minute after 40,000 years. Because of\n  background radiation, that's about as far as one can normally go with\n  this counting method. As noted above, Dr. Dalrymple would extend that\n  to 50,000 years in special laboratories.\n  \n  Once again, Dr. Hovind has relied on bad data. If you get your\n  information from a creationist source, you'd better triple-check it!\n  Errors get handed down in the creationist literature like the family\n  jewels!\n  \n  Dr. Hovind (R6): The shape of the curve of the line is based on too\n  few real measurements to be reliable. R6. It's not clear to me what\n  Dr. Hovind is talking about. If he is referring to the carbon-14 decay\n  curve then he has demonstrated, once again, his ignorance of\n  radiometric dating.\n  \n  The decay curve is mathematically determined by the fact that every\n  atom of carbon-14 in a sample has the same chance of decaying during\n  each second of time. That much is predicted by quantum mechanics,\n  which is possibly the greatest of our modern, scientific revolutions.\n  \n  The random character of radioactive decay is a special case of the\n  indeterminacy of quantum theory, as was pointed out in 1928 by George\n  Gamow, Ronald Gurney and Edward Condon. They showed that a particle\n  held inside the nucleus by a \"potential barrier\" may be able to\n  \"tunnel through\" the barrier and emerge on the other side, since if\n  the barrier is finite the wave function of the particle is not\n  completely localized and there is a finite probability that the\n  particle will be outside the nucleus.\n  \n  (Brush, 1982, p.42)\n  \n  Since we are dealing with millions of C-14 atoms in even the smallest\n  samples, the amount of C-14 remaining with respect to time will be an\n  excellent approximation of an exponential decay curve. Statistics\n  assure us of that. Indeed, it would be absurd to speak of the\n  half-life of a radioactive isotope if it did not have a good\n  exponential decay curve!\n  \n  Once we have a good approximation of the half-life for carbon-14, its\n  decay curve can be constructed with complete confidence. We don't need\n  Egyptian mummies or what have you at that point. At that point it's\n  just a routine exercise in math. If you want additional assurance that\n  we have the correct half-life, then look at the close correlation\n  between C-14 dates and tree-ring dates (after correcting for variances\n  in C-14 production caused by changes in the earth's magnetic field).\n  The snug fit indicates that the half-life of C-14 is stable and\n  accurately known. Therefore, so is its decay curve.\n  \n  Today, the half-lives of those radioactive elements used in dating are\n  known to a few percent by careful laboratory study. So, there's no\n  problem in getting an accurate decay curve.\n  -http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind/howgood-c14.html\n\n\nAll said and done, radiometric dating methods provide a reliable means of determining the ages of critical points in geologic and planetary history, including the age of the Earth, the Moon, and meteorites. That the age of the Earth is billions of years is virtually beyond question because it is supported by a wide variety of independently determined scientific evidence which indicates that the Earth is 4.5 to 4.6 billion years old. Scientists are continually refining this age, but it is highly unlikely that it will change in the future by more than a few percent. In the past, the age of the Earth was the subject of much dispute, but the past few decades have seen the development of new techniques not previously available. There is virtually no dispute among knowledgeable scientists about the antiquity of the Earth and her sister planets.\n\nCreationism\n\nCreationists calculate the age of the earth to be (depending on the sect of creationists,) from 6,000 to 200,000 years old, with the majority coming in at 10,000 years old. These calculations are derived from numerous methods like Thomas Barnes' decay of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, in his book, \"Origin and destiny of the earth's magnetic field.\" This is a list of the tabulated ages of the Earth. Keep in mind that none of these methods and results are scientifically valid.\n\nWhen it comes to young earth creationists, in my opinion the most misinformed segment of creationists, the method originally used to calculate the age of the earth (and therefore a max age of the life on the earth,) was using the genealogies from the Bible.\n\n\n  The Bible begins with the Book of Genesis, in which God creates the\n  world, including the first human, a man named Adam, in six days.\n  Genesis goes on to list many of Adam's descendants, in many cases\n  giving the ages at which they had children and died. If these events\n  and ages are interpreted literally throughout and the genealogies are\n  considered closed, it is possible to build up a chronology in which\n  many of the events of the Old Testament are dated to an estimated\n  number of years after creation. Some scholars have gone further, and\n  have attempted to tie in this Biblical chronology with that of\n  recorded history, thus establishing a date for creation in a modern\n  calendar. Since there are periods in the Biblical story where dates\n  are not given, the chronology has been subject to interpretation in\n  many different ways, resulting in a variety of estimates of the date\n  of creation.\n  \n  Numerous efforts have been made to determine the Biblical date of\n  creation, yielding varying results. Besides differences in\n  interpretation, which version of the Bible is being referenced also\n  impacts on the result. Two dominant dates for creation using such\n  models exist, about 5500 BC and about 4000 BC. These were calculated\n  from the genealogies in two versions of the Bible, with most of the\n  difference arising from two versions of Genesis. The older dates are\n  based on the Greek Septuagint. The later dates are based on the Hebrew\n  Masoretic text.[58] The patriarchs from Adam to Terah, the father of\n  Abraham, were often 100 years older when they begat their named son in\n  the Septuagint than they were in the Hebrew or the Vulgate (Genesis 5,\n  11). The net difference between the two genealogies of Genesis was\n  1466 years (ignoring the \"second year after the flood\" ambiguity),\n  which is virtually all of the 1500-year difference between 5500 BC and\n  4000 BC. For example, the period of creation to the Flood is derived\n  using the genealogical table of the ten patriarchs listed in Genesis\n  5, and 7:6, called the generations of Adam. According to the Masoretic\n  Text, this period consists of 1,656 years, and this dating is also\n  followed by Western Christian Bibles derived from the Latin Vulgate.\n  However, according to the Samaritan texts the period is 1,307 years,\n  and according to the Septuagint (Codex Alexandrinus, Elizabeth Bible)\n  it is 2,262 years. J. Ussher agrees with the dating until the birth of\n  Abraham, which he argues took place when Terah was 130, and not 70 as\n  is the direct reading of Genesis 11:26, thus adding 60 years to his\n  chronology for events postdating Abraham.\n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_creation#Biblical_creation_dates\n\n\nMany ancient cultures tried to calculate the age of the earth, and since they didn't have to tools and knowledge that we have now, they usually based it on human record and creation myths.

The amount of trans fat in a serving of peanut butter is far less than the limit of 0.5 grams that needs to be reported as above zero. Only a tiny amount of hydrogenated vegetable oil is added to peanut butter to make it smooth, prevent separation, and drastically increase shelf life, and only a small amount of that small amount is in the form of trans fat.

This assumption forms the basis for the assertion that \"lack of breakfast\" is \"brain damaging\".\n\nSo I would answer it in two steps.\n\nStep 1. Is dietary calorie restriction detrimental?\n\nMuch to the contrary, there is ample evidence suggesting that calorie restriction (CR) increases general health, and lengthens life.\n\nI quote the paper below on studies with humans:\n\n\n  This evidence consists of the finding that risk factors for atherosclerosis and diabetes are markedly reduced in humans on CR. Humans on CR also show some of the same adaptations that are thought to be involved in slowing primary aging in rats and mice. These include a very low level of inflammation as evidenced by low circulatory levels of c-reactive protein and TNF\u03b1, serum triiodothyronine levels at the low end of the normal range, and a more elastic \u201cyounger\u201d left ventricle (LV), as evaluated by echo-doppler measures of LV stiffness.\n\n\nFrom the same paper, some anedoctal evidence:\n\n\n  Okinawans, because of poverty, were so severely calorie restricted that their growth was stunted. However, public health measures and quality of the diet on Okinawa were sufficiently good to prevent the high prevalence of nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases present among the poor in many third world countries. It is interesting, relative to the possible effects of CR on human longevity, that there are more centenarians per 100,000 people in Okinawa than in other parts of the world including the USA and Western Europe (Chan et al., 1997). \n\n\nAnd from the one on brain effects of CR:\n\n\n  These beneficial effects also extend to the maintenance of brain cognitive functions at later age and to the prevention, at least in rodents, of brain senescence and associated neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n\n\nCaloric restriction in humans\nDietary restriction in rats and mice\nBrain response to calorie restriction\n\n\nStep 2. Is skipping breakfast detrimental?\n\nYes, but not because calorie restriction is generally bad. Some studies (see below) suggest that skipping breakfast might lead people to overeat later in the day, which in turn would cause obesity.\n\n\nDo we all eat breakfast and is it important?\nSkipping breakfast and obesity: Comparing Eastern and Western populations\n\n\nOn whether this is bad for the brain,\n\n\n  The evidence indicates that breakfast consumption is more beneficial than skipping breakfast, but this effect is more apparent in children whose nutritional status is compromised.\n\n\n\nCognitive performance after skipping breakfast\n\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on this evidence, I believe there is no direct causal relationship between skipping breakfast, low blood sugar and brain degeneration (as the original statements implied).\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/14745#17587", "answerId": "17587"}

However, he advised the company to consider and incorporate potential \u201cnegative outcomes\u201d ...\n\n\nThe collection of documents also shows evidence of a far better-known strategy by Exxon: the public attack on climate science and FUD campaigns that began in 1999. This has included objections to scientific opinion and funding of what is properly called climate denialism.\n\nBut I see no evidence that Exxon was trying to suppress climate change information when the field was first starting out in the 1980s, unless if there was a vast conspiracy involving fake internal documents.

When there is food in the stomach the pH can raise to as high as 4-5. After the food leaves the stomach bicarbonate ions are secreted to neutralize and alkalinize the mixture.

Although regulation of intracellular pH has been shown to be critically important for many cellular functions, pH regulation has not been fully investigated in the field of cancer. It has, however, been shown that cellular pH is crucial for biological functions such as cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis, drug resistance and apoptosis. Hypoxic conditions are often observed during the development of solid tumours and lead to intracellular and extracellular acidosis. Cellular acidosis has been shown to be a trigger in the early phase of apoptosis and leads to activation of endonucleases inducing DNA fragmentation. To avoid intracellular acidification under such conditions, pH regulators are thought to be up-regulated in tumour cells. Four major types of pH regulator have been identified: the proton pump, the sodium-proton exchanger family (NHE), the bicarbonate transporter family (BCT) and the monocarboxylate transporter family (MCT). Here, we describe the structure and function of pH regulators expressed in tumour tissue. Understanding pH regulation in tumour cells may provide new ways of inducing tumour-specific apoptosis, thus aiding cancer chemotherapy.\n\n\nFrom Cellular pH regulators: potentially promising molecular targets for cancer chemotherapy.\n\n5\n\n\n  Cells must constantly maintain their pH in order to function properly. In animals, for example, the maintainence of blood pH is crucial for life. A slightly acidic pH (6.95) would result in coma and death.

When a child is born, they are born with their 'bones' made largely of cartilage. As we grow our bones Ossify, becoming harder and less prone to breakages (fracture risks peak in early adolescence). A similar process also occurs with our ligaments, which tighten and strengthen into maturity.\n\nBecause there are no direct studies done on joint locks in children (at least, not that I can find), I can concentrate on an example that mimics the forces you might see in a joint lock. The example I am going to concentrate on is radial head subluxation. A pulling motion on the elbow (imagine lifting a child up by the forearms), can cause progressive damage to the annular ligament in the elbow. This damage, as demonstrated by epidemiological studies, is much much more common in young children. \n\nNow, this really concentrates on the effects of acute injuries. I can't justify with evidence the notion that any gentle joint locks (not causing immediate injury or tear to the ligaments), would cause any long term damage. But the point is, that any acute/traumatic injuries can cause long term problems, and these acute issue are much more common in children. As such, joint locks on children should be practiced only under strict supervision, but as long as you're careful I can find no evidence that the correct, careful and responsible practice of joint locks would cause any long term issues.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22696#22728", "answerId": "22728"}

Mostly, they were depressed or anxious, and frustrated by the\n  pace of their recovery.\n  \n  Leuchter wondered what was up: Depressed patients didn't usually seek\n  out drugs used to quell psychiatry's most disturbing symptoms.\n  \n  What was up, he soon discovered, was spending on a new advertising\n  campaign touting Abilify as an \"add-on\" treatment for depression. For\n  the first time since the arrival of a new generation of antipsychotic\n  medications -- six drugs called the \"atypicals\" because they work\n  differently from the earlier generation of antipsychotic drugs -- the\n  makers of one, Abilify, had been granted the legal right to market to\n  a vast new population of patients beyond those with schizophrenia or\n  bipolar disorder. - source\n\n\nOK. Nothing wrong with some advertising, right? We know the rules.\n\n\n  Advertising and Marketing - Pharmaceutical manufacturers make\n  substantial investments on marketing to consumers and physicians,\n  which may influence consumer demand and physician prescribing\n  practices. Furthermore, the most heavily advertised products tend to\n  be newer, more expensive drugs. This results in overall increases in\n  spending. - source\n\n\nThe guys at Healthcare Finance News are bullish...\n\n\n  The broad clinical profile of atypical antipsychotics allows them to\n  target a spectrum of psychiatric indications, increasing access to a\n  wider variety and larger number of patients and therefore driving\n  sales prescriptions and revenues. Pursuing indication expansion,\n  AstraZeneca\u2019s Seroquel (quetiapine) and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zyprexa\n  (olanzapine) became the biggest selling antipsychotics in 2008 with\n  global sales of $5.5 bn and $5.4 bn respectively. - source\n\n\n2007: Fine: $515 million.

They also point to notes\n  from Lilly sales representatives through 2003 recording efforts to\n  press doctors to prescribe elderly patients Zyprexa for mood symptoms,\n  irritability and insomnia. - source\n\n\n2009: Fine: $520 million.\n\n\n  AstraZeneca becomes the fourth pharmaceutical giant in the last three\n  years to admit to federal charges of illegal marketing of\n  antipsychotic drugs, a lucrative category of medications that have\n  quickly risen to the top of United States sales charts. Aggressive\n  sales and promotional practices have helped expand the use of powerful\n  new antipsychotic drugs for children and the elderly. - source\n\n\n\nManageable side effect\n\n\n  In 2001, marketing executives advised salespeople not to duck\n  questions about whether Zyprexa caused some users to gain weight,\n  according to an internal memo.\n  \n  \u201cAcknowledge weight gain but present it as a manageable side effect,\u201d\n  Lilly advised its sales force, according to the documents. \u201cWith most\n  customers, we will continue to address the diabetes concern only when\n  it arises,\u201d the December 2001 document said. \u201cGet back to selling!\u201d -\n  source\n\n\nSmoke and mirrors\n\n\n  The company has argued that people who were found to have diabetes\n  after taking Seroquel already had diabetes or had existing conditions\n  that made them at high risk of the disease.    \n  \n  According to company e-mail unsealed in civil lawsuits, AstraZeneca\n  \u201cburied\u201d \u2014 a manager\u2019s term \u2014 a 1997 study that showed Seroquel users\n  gained 11 pounds a year, while publicizing a study that claimed users\n  lost weight.

{"question": "Is it possible to determine dishonesty in a person through body language?", "questionId": "22154", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22154", "category": "psychology", "categoryId": 4, "answer": "\n  Is it possible to determine dishonesty in a person through body language?\n\n\nNo. \"to determine\" is a categorical verb. Maybe \"to suspect\" would have been more appropriate. \n\nSo, what does body language include? According to The Free Dictionary by Farlex:\n\n\ngestures  \npostures  \nfacial expressions, which according to Paul Elkman are of four types:\n\n\nmacroexpressions - these are normal expressions, so you wouldn't expect these from a liar\nmicroexpressions - these are of interest, but they last only 67 miliseconds which makes them difficult to detect and very easy to miss\nfalse expressions\nmasked expressions\n\n\n\nGestures and postures\n\nHere are some gestures common when lying: the neck scratch, covering the mouth or touching your face [1]. But none can be specific to lying. Most people believe that liars avoid eye contact [2]. So if someone avoids eye contact it means that person is lying? No. Children who avoid eye contact when answering questions are providing better answers [3]. What about Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Native American cultures which believe eye contact is disrespectful [4]? Several studies concluded that gestures are an important addition to verbal communication. It seems that the effects of gestures are larger when they are not overlapping the verbal information [5]. What kind of gestures accompany a speech is determined by situation [6] so you can't assess someone's gestures without evaluating the corresponding speech. Listeners attempt to find a meaning also in the hand movements that accompany speech [7].\n\nBody posture seems to be correlated with the manifestations of power [8]. In sports, specific deceptive movements can trick the opponent [9]. But the opponent can learn to spot those movements [10].\n\nFacial expressions\n\nA trained eye can spot someone's feelings and emotions (practice helps [12]):\n\n\n  Relative to genuine emotions, masked emotions were associated with more inconsistent expressions and an elevated blink rate; neutralized emotions showed a decreased blink rate. Negative emotions were more difficult to falsify than happiness [11].\n\n\nBut the context influences how one can detect microexpressions:\n\n\n  The results of Experiments 1 and 2 showed that negative context impaired the recognition of micro-expressions regardless of the duration of the target micro-expression. Stimulus-difference between the context and target micro-expression was accounted for in Experiment 3. Results showed that a context effect on micro-expression recognition persists even when the stimulus similarity between the context and target micro-expressions was controlled. Therefore, our results not only provided evidence for the context effect on micro-expression recognition but also suggested that the context effect might result from both the stimulus and valence differences [13].\n\n\nConclusion\n\nYes, body language is useful to detect someone's emotions. So, why my answer to the main question is \"no\"?\n\n\n(negative) emotion is not the same as dishonesty\nyou can't get a definitive conclusion\nbody language should be assessed in correlation with context, verbal communication and key emotional circumstances\nthe conditions in the above line affect assessor's ability to spot specific changes \nit is not possible to make a \"standard\" protocol to detect lies. This depends on situation, assessor's intelligence and intuition, liar's experience etc.\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nBodyLanguageUniversity.com. Accessed 29.06.2014.

However:\n\n\nThe new definition of centigrade is different, it depends on absolute zero degrees and the triple point of water.\n\n\n  From 1744 until 1954, 0 \u00b0C was defined as the freezing point of water and 100 \u00b0C was defined as the boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one standard atmosphere with mercury being the working material. Although these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today, by international agreement the unit \"degree Celsius\" and the Celsius scale are currently defined by two different temperatures: absolute zero, and the triple point of VSMOW (specially purified water). This definition also precisely relates the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale, which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol K. Absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible, is defined as being precisely 0 K and \u2212273.15 \u00b0C.

It seems hard to believe, but some people swear that it is so. (emphasize mine):\n\n\n  Cold water does not boil faster than hot water. The rate of heating of a liquid depends on the magnitude of the temperature difference between the liquid and its surroundings (the flame on the stove, for instance). As a result, cold water will be absorbing heat faster while it is still cold; once it gets up to the temperature of hot water, the heating rate slows down and from there it takes just as long to bring it to a boil as the water that was hot to begin with. Because it takes cold water some time to reach the temperature of hot water, cold water clearly takes longer to boil than hot water does. There may be some psychological effect at play; cold water starts boiling sooner than one might expect because of the aforementioned greater heat absorption rate when water is colder. \n\n\nIt even suggests you try it out yourself:\n\n\n  You can readily set up an experiment to learn which freezes earlier: water that is initially hot, or water that is initially cold. Use a given setting on an electric hot plate and clock the time between start and boiling for a given pot containing, say, one quart of water; first start with the water as cold as the tap will provide and then repeat it with the hottest water available from that tap.

Over the course of 12 weeks, water drinkers lost about 15.5 pounds, while the non-water drinkers lost about 11 pounds.\n\n\nThermogenesis, the idea that you burn calories by drinking cold water because your body has to work to heat it up, currently is discredited due to the evidence showing that it accounts for a few calories at most if you constantly drink ice water.\n\nLastly, there is some small benefit found in substituting water for other beverages simply because water has no calories, so drinking a glass of water instead of a glass of juice or cola is a net difference in calories.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/23289#23302", "answerId": "23302"}

The basic point is that additional CO2 is good for plants, provided they are in an environment where CO2 is a limiting factor in growth, i.e. they already have adequate water, sunlight, nutrients etc.  This is why additional CO2 is sometimes introduced into greenhouses, where watering, sunlight and feeding are already well optimized.  However outside greenhouses, CO2 is not generally a limiting factor. Quite often the low availability of water (e.g. due to drought) or poor soils (due to over-farming) is what prevents productivity, and adding extra CO2 is of little or no use to plants.  CO2 however, is a greenhouse gas, and can be expected to produce warming, which may have a negative effect on water availability, and for some plants temperature is a limit on where they can grow.  Simplistic arguments are generally unlikely to be true on this one as there are many factors that are involved.\n\nAs an example where Dr Idso's argument clearly is not the case, consider this study:\n\n\n  Insects Take A Bigger Bite Out Of Plants In A Higher Carbon Dioxide\n  World\n  \n  Date: March 25, 2008\n  \n  Source: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n  \n  Summary: Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are rising at an alarming\n  rate, and new research indicates that soybean plant defenses go down\n  as carbon dioxide goes up. Elevated carbon dioxide impairs a key\n  component of the plant's defenses against leaf-eating insects,\n  according to a new article.\n\n\nThere are references to other studies at the SkS article mentioned above (especially the advanced version).\n\nThe problem is that you can always cherry pick studies to support a point of view, but the best course of action depends on taking a broader view of the scientific literature, and consider what is likely to happen in the real-world biosphere (i.e. you need to consider the local limiting factors around the world on a family-by-family basis).  The IPCC WG2 report is probably a good place to start.  I'm much more familiar with WG1 issues, rather than WG2, but this article suggests that the IPCC do not agree with Dr Idso.\n\nI should however point out that Dr Idso is presenting this work at a conference for climate skeptics only, funded by the Heartland Institute (a political lobbying organisation).  It isn't the sort of place he is likely to get a serious scientific peer review of his work that will point out the errors.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22292#22293", "answerId": "22293"}

The mechanism that this is supposed to work by is as some sort of antibacterial agent.  Although, the mild acid in vinegar really is nothing compared to the acids that are already in your stomach.  The main reason that vinegar is associated as a food poisoning remedy could be because vinegar is often used as a method of preserving food for longer periods (i.e. pickling).\n\nOr as is mentioned at the Washington State University site\n\n\n  ORGANIC ACIDS: As you recall, all microbes require an #optimum pH or acidity in their environment to grow. If there is too much acid or base, a microbe will not grow. As the by-products of many microbial fermentations include the production of chemicals like ACETIC ACID (vinegar), LACTIC ACID, and PROPIONIC ACID it is not too surprising to find that humans, and other life, can actually use these substances as nutrients. However, when they are added to foods in sufficient quantities to lower the pH below that which will support the growth of most food-spoilage microbes, they can serve as natural food preservatives. Again, our ancestors recognized that \"SPOILED\" foods such as milk and certain vegetables, retained their nutrition upon becoming acidic and remained eatable (preserved) for long periods. Thus was born choice food items like yogurt, sauerkraut, pickles, cheese and buttermilk. Artificial acids, like benzoic acid, inhibit the growth of some molds, thus it is added to breads and other bakery products that require long shelf live. In many foods, like the sauerkraut you made in lab, salt is combined with acids to preserve food. \n\n\nThis site from the University of Maryland Medical Center states\n\n\n  Apple cider vinegar is a traditional remedy that, although it has not been studied scientifically, may have some antimicrobial properties. Mix 2 tsp. in one cup warm water and drink several times a day.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  No studies back it up, but there appears to be no harm in doing it as long as you dilute the vinegar.\n\nKeep in mind, if someone has ingested a non-food poison, Poison Control Centers specifically state\n\n\n  Do not give salt, vinegar, citrus juice or induce vomiting unless instructed to do so by the Poison Control Center.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5953#5954", "answerId": "5954"}

They do not claim to disprove Ruddiman's hypothesis, merely that the evidence isn't strong enough (as at 2004) to accept it.\n\nJoos et. al. (2004) find that Ruddiman's hypothesis would require a larger decrease in the atmospheric ratio of two (stable) carbon isotopes (13C:12C) than is observed in ice core data (methane has a lower ratio than the atmosphere at large, so large releases of methane would decrease the ratio in the whole atmosphere). They estimate that changes in land use around the time probably caused a 4-6ppm rise in CO2 levels, compared to a Ruddiman's 2003 estimate of 40ppm.\n\nClausen et. al. (2005) take a rather nuanced view, but, while they have several issues with Ruddiman's hypothesis, and its incompatibility with Joos et. al.'s results, they acknowledge that Ruddiman has a point, and that natural variation isn't sufficient to explain pre-industrial changes observed.\n\nMore recently, Kaplan et. al. (2010) pointed out that many lines of evidence suggest that the assumptions of constant land use per capita cannot be supported, and so can revise previous estimates upwards, figuring that anthropogenic emissions contributed a 7ppm rise in CO2 levels by 1000BC, and around 22ppm by 1850AD, and that these were sufficient to alter the climate (but not necessarily enough to prevent an ice age). \n\nIn 2005, Gavin Schmidt (a top climate scientist, and coauthor of one the papers I mentioned earlier) identified the hypothesis as one causing genuine debate in the scientific community. Meanwhile, Real Climate (a blog coauthored by several top climate scientists, including Schmidt) has offered Ruddiman several opportunities to expound on his hypothesis [1, 2], most recently less than a month ago, suggesting that they see it as a legitimate question.\n\nIt does seem that pre-industrial human actions were sufficient to alter the climate to some extent. Most recent results have suggested that this impact was less than originally estimated by Ruddiman, but sufficient to have a notable impact on the climate. Whether they were enough to prevent an ice age? Probably not, but not out of the question. \n\nMeanwhile, Ruddiman does seem to have kicked off a very productive area of enquiry into pre-industrial anthropogenic climate changes. This does seem to be something that more sophisticated modelling and better paleoclimate data will reveal more information on in the future.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1801#2868", "answerId": "2868"}

And by Suma in the flatworms question. \n\n\n  \"The idea that transplanting organs\n  transfers the coding of life\n  experiences is unimaginable.\"  --Dr.\n  John Schroeder,  Stanford Medical\n  Center\n\n\nThere is simply no scientific reason to think that somehow memories of one person are stored in cells and can be passed from one person to another during transplantation.  There is not even a scientifically theorized mechanism by which it could happen.  The claim remains purely pseudoscientific and proponents often rely on anecdotes, coincidence, and anomaly hunting to make their case.  \n\nFirst, if such a thing were true, I might call attention to the problems which would be faced by the following people:\n\nsource\n\nsource\n\nand of course, the comically terrifying applications it would have considering this...\n\nsource\n\n\n\nObviously, receiving a life-saving or life-changing organ transplant has profound physiological, social and psychological effects on a person.\n\n\n  An organ transplant is a life-altering\n  experience, literally. In many cases,\n  it might well be compared to the\n  near-death experience since many\n  transplants are done only if death is\n  imminent. It should not be surprising\n  to find that many transplant\n  recipients change significantly. Some\n  of these changes might easily be\n  interpreted as being consistent with\n  the donor's likes and dislikes or\n  behaviors. Recipients would want to\n  know about their donor and might\n  consciously or unconsciously be\n  influenced by stories about the person\n  who now \"lives inside them.\" source\n\n\nIt's not surprising how many people could conceivably interpret a mystical significance to some of the changes they are experiencing, but as we can see, changes are normal after such a procedure, even ones the general public might not expect, such as \"memory improvement following cardiac transplantation\"\n\n\n  Pre-transplant testing revealed normal\n  intelligence and normal attentional,\n  language, and executive abilities but\n  impaired recent memory. Following\n  heart transplant, memory functioning\n  improved significantly, reaching\n  normal levels. Other cognitive\n  abilities remained unchanged. Results\n  suggest that cardiomyopathy is\n  associated with mesial temporal\n  dysfunction, possibly attributable to\n  inadequate or reduced cerebral blood\n  flow and related hypometabolism\n\n\nOf course it's quite tempting to think simply that the transplanted heart might have come from a very intelligent person, especially if it did happen to come from an individual with above average intelligence.\n\nThere are bound to be strange coincidences, strange similarities between donor and recipient.  There are bound to be anecdotal stories which sound astonishing, but given the sheer volume of transplants performed this year alone\n\n source\n\nthe 73 cases Pearsall lists in his book (cited in the question) seem even less compelling.  Especially since he has had some noted \"credibility\" issues in the past\n\n\n  Dr Pearsall claims that he is \u201cFully\n  licensed and board certified clinical\n  neuropsychologist, License Number\n  000773\u2032\u2032 Even better, the American\n  Board of Clinical Neuropsychology\n  lists all its members and guess what,\n  under \u2018P\u2019 for Pearsall, no-one of that\n  name exists. source\n\n\nI certainly wouldn't say these claims are \"legion\".  But of course, you can try to stretch the data that way if you keep the claims vague and apply them to subjective things like \"developing tastes\" or \"artistic capability\" such as the case of William Sheridan.\n\n\n  William Sheridan's drawing skills were\n  stuck at nursery level. His stick\n  figures were the sort you would expect\n  of a child. But as he convalesced\n  after a heart transplant operation, he\n  experienced an astonishing revelation\n\n\nI'd say that's subjective, as his art went from this....\n\n\n\nto this...\n\n\n\nwhich could likely be explained by any number of natural mechanisms, such as having more time to practice drawing while recovering, or even perhaps as a result of the increase in cognitive function seen in some heart transplant patients as I noted above.\n\nWith regard to the much more widely-known case of Claire Sylvia, one needs only to look at the words of William Novak, one of her supporters....\n\n\n  \"The point is that Claire  is not\n  claiming that you take  on the entire\n  personality of the donor, just\n  fragments that come through. One  of\n  the things I like about her is that\n  she doesn't make grand, sweeping, hard\n  to believe  claims. She  doesn't claim\n  she  is two people  at once, but she \n  does believe that something unusual\n  has happened\" source\n\n\nHe is absolutely correct, something unusual did happen.  Claire Sylvia was the first woman in New England to successfully undergo a heart-lung transplant. It's easy to see how her entire case could get blown out of proportion, especially given the media's tendency to report \"the miracles of modern medicine\" as simply \"miracles\".\n\n\n  Sylvia, 47, was dying from pulmonary\n  hypertension \u2014 a disease that\n  increases the body's blood pressure in\n  the lung vasculature and most often\n  leads to death \u2014 in 1988 when she\n  became the first person in New England\n  to have a heart-lung transplant.\n  source\n\n\nand as such, she was given some attention from the media,and anything she said was almost guaranteed an audience.\n\n\n  Because I was the first person in the\n  state to have such an operation, there\n  was a lot of publicity, and two\n  reporters came to the hospital to\n  interview me.source\n\n\nIt's also very possible that the life and death of the donor could have received equal attention from the journalists, even if it was not equally reported. This could quite logically have caused Sylvia to be exposed to leading questions from journalists who had already researched the life and death of Tim Lamirande. The always-tragic motorcycle crash death of an 18 year old boy is likely to make the news, let alone when it becomes intertwined with a medical \"breakthrough\" such as this.

There was no \"centre\" to the Big Bang; the (hypothetical) point source was all of the universe. There was no space expanding from that point, space itself was expanding.\n\nHence light from the BB was everywhere in the whole universe. If you were there it would be like living in the middle of a massive fireball - so there cannot be any shadows in any direction. You could not be at the \"edge\" of that fireball, everything was in the middle of it. And, until 380,000 years after the BB, photons were not free to travel, as the universe was not even transparent to light.\n\nAt the time of the CMB, 380,000 years after the BB, the temperature of the universe was about 3,000K, roughly the melting temperature of Tungsten, or double the melting point of Iron. At that temperature, electrons and nucleons could just combine into atoms, and, as it was no longer a plasma, the universe became transparent to radiation. But to this question it does not really matter what the temperature was, as everything was at the same temperature, accurate within about 1 part in 10,000, as reflected in the anisotropy of the BB.\n\nEDIT\n\nThe effect mentioned in the OP comes from a study in 2006 by Dr Lieu of the University of Alabama. It relates to the fact that, although the CMB comes from everywhere, in the direction of glacatic clusters we should see a reduction in the glow. This is caused by ionised gases in the cluster distorting the CMB and is called the Sunyaev\u2013Zel\u2019dovich effect (SZE). Dr Lieu found that the signal from the direction of clusters did not match the predicted SZE. However, in 2009 Diego and Partridge used more data from the WMAP probe and found that, while there are still some discrepancies, they depend strongly on the particular model used, and they can accommodate the measurements.

What does that chock up to? An\n  eight-ounce cup of decaf coffee would have no more than 5 or fewer\n  milligrams of caffeine (compared to the range of 40 - 180 mg.\n  typically found in one eight-ounce cup of brewed, dripped, or\n  percolated java). \n  \n  Today, most processors use safe methods to remove\n  caffeine. A few different techniques are available, and understanding\n  them may help allay your concerns about coffee contaminants. Coffee\n  beans are decaffeinated by softening the beans with water and using a\n  substance to extract the caffeine. Water alone cannot be used because\n  it strips away too much of the flavor. The goal is to extract the\n  caffeine with minimal loss of flavor. Substances used to remove the\n  caffeine may directly or indirectly come in contact with the beans,\n  and so the processes are referred to as direct or indirect\n  decaffeination. \n  \n  In one process, coffee beans are soaked in water to\n  soften them and dissolve the caffeine. The water containing the\n  caffeine (and the flavor from the beans) is treated with a solvent,\n  heated to remove the solvent and caffeine, and then returned to the\n  beans. The flavors in the water are reabsorbed by the beans, which are\n  then dried. This process is referred to as \"indirect decaffeination,\"\n  because the beans never touch the solvent themselves. The most widely\n  used solvent today is ethyl acetate, a substance found in many fruits.\n  When your coffee label states that the beans are \"naturally\n  decaffeinated,\" it is referring to this process, specifically using\n  ethyl acetate. Although it doesn't sound like a natural process, it\n  can be labeled as such because the solvent occurs in nature. Other\n  solvents have been used, some of which have been shown to be harmful.\n  One, methylene chloride, has been alleged to cause cancer in humans\n  and therefore is not often used. Back in the 1970s, another solvent,\n  trichloroethylene, was found to be carcinogenic and is no longer used.\n  \n  Another indirect method soaks the beans in water to soften them and\n  remove the caffeine, and then runs the liquid through activated\n  charcoal or carbon filters to decaffeinate it. The flavor containing\n  fluid is then returned to the beans to be dried. This charcoal or\n  carbon process is often called \"Swiss water process\" (developed by a\n  Swiss company). \n  \n  Your concern over the safety of decaffeinated coffee\n  probably stems from solvents used in the past. If your coffee is\n  labeled naturally decaffeinated or Swiss water processed, you can be\n  assured that no harmful chemicals are used. If you are uncertain, you\n  can ask or call your coffee processor to learn about the method used.\n\n\nI think it is safe to say that any decaffeinated coffee purchased in a country that competently regulates food safety is safe to consume\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8110#8122", "answerId": "8122"}
{"question": "Do bees pollinate 1/3 of the world's food sources?", "questionId": "30495", "questionUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/30495", "category": "nutrition", "categoryId": 0, "answer": "Not likely, as a third of our diet is dependent on insects and not specifically bees.\n\nThe 1/3 measure has been cited in a variety of manners from \"1/3 of volume\" to \"one of every three bites\" to \"a third of the plants that we consume for food\". It looks like the original quote, from 1976, is from a fellow by the name of McGregor, who was talking about insect pollination in general, not about bees, as seen in this article:\n\n\n  Although estimates of the proportion of the human diet that is attributable to animal pollination are occasionally attempted and frequently cited (for example, McGregor\u2019s 1976 estimate that one-third of the human diet can be traced directly or indirectly to animal pollination), the proportion likely varies among countries and regions and depends on dietary preferences, seasonal availability, cultural practices, and economic status of consumers.\n\n\nThis is apparently sourced from \"McGregor, S.E. 1976. Insect Pollination of Cultivated Crop Plants. USDA Handbook 496. Washington: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research\" (link).\n\nThe relevant bit discusses a little of the breakdown between animal and plant sources:\n\n\n  Worldwide, more than 3,000 plant species have been used as food, only 300 of which are now widely grown, and only 12 of which furnish nearly 90 percent of the world\u2019s food. These 12 include the grains: rice, wheat, maize (corn), sorghums, millets, rye, and barley, and potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassavas or\n  maniocs, bananas, and coconuts (Thurston 1969).1 The grains are wind-pollinated or self-pollinated, coconuts are partially wind-pollinated and partially insect pollinated, and the others are propagated asexually or develop parthenocarpically. However, more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s population is in Southeast Asia where the staple diet is rice. Superficially, it appears that insect-pollination has little effect on the world\u2019s food supply \u2013 possibly no more than 1 percent.\n  \n  Within the United States, which accounts for only about 6 percent of the world\u2019s population, about 286 million acres were cultivated in 1969. About 180 million acres were devoted to the wind pollinated or self- pollinated crops, primarily barley, corn, oats, rice, rye, sorghums and wheat, grass hay crops, sugar beets, sugar cane, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and tobacco. About 60 million acres were devoted to crops that may receive some benefit from insect pollination but are largely self-pollinating (beans, cotton, flax, peanuts, peas, and soybeans). About 40 million acres were devoted to hay crops produced from bee-pollinated seeds (alfalfa, clovers, lespedezas). About 6 million acres were devoted to producing fruits, vegetables, and nuts\u2013most of which are dependent upon insect pollination. Table 1 lists the cultivated crop plants, discussed herein, that are dependent upon or benefited by insect pollination. These plants provide about 15 percent of our diet.\n  \n  The animal products we consume contribute about an equal amount to our diet. These include beef, pork, poultry, lamb, and dairy products\u2013derived one way or another from insect-pollinated legumes such as alfalfa, clover, lespedeza, and trefoil.\n  \n  More than half of the world\u2019s diet of fats and oils comes from oilseeds\u2013coconuts, cotton, oil palm, olives, peanuts, rape, soybeans, and sunflower (Guidry 1964). Many of these plants are dependent upon or benefited by insect pollination. When these sources, the animal and plant products, are considered, it appears that perhaps one-third of our total diet is dependent, directly or indirectly, upon insect-pollinated plants.\n\n\nA more recent study by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, \"How much does agriculture depend on pollinators? Lessons from long-term trends in crop production\" comes up with different results:\n\n\n  .... A recent analysis[ii] of yearly crop data maintained by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) from 1961 to 2006 reached some divergent conclusions and shed light on the interacting complexity of the question \u201cHow important is animal-vectored pollination?\u201d\n  \n  The authors of the FAO analysis concluded that the proportion of global food production attributable to animal pollination ranges from 5% in industrialized nations to 8% in the developing world. These numbers are in stark contrast with McGregor and can be explained by the fact that his and other earlier estimates tended to minimize the degree to which crops vary in their dependence on animal pollinators. About 75% of the world\u2019s crops benefit to some degree from animal pollination; only 10% of that 75% depend fully on animal pollination.\n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/30495#30506", "answerId": "30506"}

Other authors speak global self-esteem and self-esteem in specific domains (instead of calling the latter \"confidence\"). And one such study discusses the degree(s) of correlation observed (which actually vary with age):\n\n\n  This study examines the development of global self-esteem and self-esteem in 6 specific domains across adolescence and young adulthood. Using a cohort-sequential design, we analyzed longitudinal data on 3,116 Norwegian men and women from 13 to 31 years of age by means of growth curve modeling. Questionnaire data provided information on global self-esteem and self-esteem in social, academic, athletic, and appearance domains. [...]  Self-esteem in the appearance domain showed high and stable correlations with global self-esteem, whereas in social domains, correlations with global self-esteem increased over age, with a particularly steep increase for romantic appeal self-esteem. [...] Low global self-esteem predicted later prescription of antidepressants, even after controlling for covariates. \n\n\nNote that the study is relatively recent (2016) and also claims to be fairly novel, at least with respect to the longitudinal aspect:\n\n\n  This study is the first to provide a comprehensive picture of the development of global and domain-specific self-esteem throughout adolescence and young adulthood using long-term longitudinal data. \n\n\nThey also note in their introduction that domain-specific self-esteem (unlike the global one) has been much less studied... but the concept[s] of domain-specific esteems are not that novel, dating back at least to 1985:\n\n\n  However, global self-esteem is also commonly conceptualized\n  as the sum of domain-specific self-concepts (e.g., physical selfesteem,\n  academic self-esteem; Marsh &amp; Shavelson, 1985). Considerably\n  less attention has been directed toward the development\n  of domain-specific self-concepts and their importance for global\n  self-esteem. We concur with several researchers who contend that\n  global self-esteem cannot be adequately understood if only its\n  global component is considered and domain-specific facets of\n  self-esteem are not taken into account (Harter, 2012; Marsh,\n  Parada, &amp; Ayotte, 2004; Marsh &amp; Shavelson, 1985; Rosenberg et\n  al., 1995). Finally, although some advances have been made\n  (Trzesniewski et al., 2006), the long-term psychosocial consequences\n  of having low versus high domain-specific self-esteem\n  has received little attention.\n  \n  \n  Harter, S.

This is probably too vague and broad to properly address here. But I will note that since global self-esteem is predictive of depression (or at least of antidepressant use, as found in the above study), and since psychological therapies work to some extent for depression, \"saying nice things to yourself\" could potentially improve self-esteen, but the devil is in the details with psychotharpy (and that caution extends to publications in the field as well).\n\nI did find one TED page detailing what presumably works and what doesn't with respect to self-talk improving self-esteem... As examples, according to that page, simple positive affirmations may backfire whereas self-compassion works. But I would keep in mind that the general reservations about research in this field almost certainly apply to the lesser studied area of self-psychotherapy. The last link/paper notes for instance that:\n\n\n  Recent reviews of the research literature suggest that self-esteem may not be the panacea\n  it\u2019s made out to be (Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, &amp; Vohs, 2003; Crocker &amp; Park,\n  2004). First, it should be noted that self-esteem is often highly resistant to change, and\n  that most programs designed to raise self-esteem fail (Swann, 1996). It also appears that\n  self-esteem is largely the outcome of doing well, not the cause of doing well. For instance,\n  self-esteem appears to be the result rather than the cause of improved academic performance\n  (Baumeister et al., 2003).\n  \n  \n  Swann, W. B. (1996).

If that assumption does not hold, then you can get into odd edge cases where lowering the set-back temperature might conceivably increase energy consumption. That would happen if the proportional decrease in heater efficiency is greater than proportional decrease in heat-energy demand. As your Capital Gazette link says, this might happen if the lower setback temperature creates a requirement for a rapid increase in internal temperature when the setback period ends, and that rapid increase has to be met by a heater with efficiency less than or equal to 100% (boiler, furnace, resistance heater), rather than a heater with a much higher efficiency (a well-specified, properly installed heat pump).\n\n\n\nfootnote:\n\nThe physics behind the CMHC finding is fairly simple: the heat loss at any one moment, for a given property, is pretty much proportional to the difference between internal and external temperature. And to get the house back up to comfortable temperature, we're going to have to put back into the house, all the heat that it's lost. So if, for a period of time, that temperature difference is lower, then the heat loss will be lower, and that's less energy we have to put back in. The temperature difference is lower, when the setback temperature is lower (assuming it's colder outside than it is inside).\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/30896#30904", "answerId": "30904"}

This is the main source and reason the myth propagates:\n\n\n  Gord Giesbrecht, a professor of thermophysiology at the University of Manitoba in Canada,14 is a leading expert on hypothermia:\n  \n  \n    It's hard to imagine death by fan, because to die of hypothermia, one's body temperature would have to get down to 28 [\u00b0C], drop by 10 degrees [Celsius] overnight. We've got people lying in snowbanks overnight here in Winnipeg and they survive. Maybe if someone was elderly and they were sitting there for three days in a sealed room with an electric fan turned on. Someone is not going to die from hypothermia because their body temperature drops two or three degrees overnight; it would have to drop eight to ten degrees.\" In addition, \"the only way to verify whether someone had really died of hypothermia during the night would be to take a core body temperature the following morning. Waiting three days while the body was in the morgue wouldn't work because the corpse's temperature can drop during that time.2\n  \n  \n  Dr. John Linton at Yonsei's Severance Hospital, who attended medical school at Yonsei University, is licensed to practice medicine in South Korea:2\n  \n  \n    There are several things that could be causing the fan deaths, things like pulmonary embolisms, cerebrovascular accidents or arrhythmia. There is little scientific evidence to support that a fan alone can kill you if you are using it in a sealed room. Although it is a common belief among Koreans, there are other explainable reasons for why these deaths are happening.\n  \n  \n  Dr. Lee Yoon-song is a professor at Seoul National University's medical school and works with the school's Institute of Scientific Investigation. He has conducted autopsies on some of the people who have been described in Korean media as having succumbed to fan death:\n  \n  \n    When someone's body temperature drops below 35 degrees, they do start to lose judgment ability. So if someone was hiking and later found dead, that could be part of the reason. But we can't really apply this to fan accidents. I found most of the victims already had some sort of disease like heart problems or serious alcoholism. So hypothermia is not the main reason for death, but it may contribute.\n  \n  \n  He blames the Korean media for the persistence of the urban legend:\n  \n  \n    Korean reporters are constantly writing inaccurate articles about death by fan, describing these deaths as being caused by the fan. That's why it seems that fan deaths only happen in Korea, when in reality these types of deaths are quite rare. They should have reported the victim's original defects such as heart or lung disease, which are the main cause of death in these cases.\n  \n\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/617#622", "answerId": "622"}

The type of rhinoceros beetle in question is the \"Hercules beetle\" (Dynastes hercules)\n\n\n  Adults of some species can lift objects 850 times their weight! That\n  would be equivalent to a human lifting 9 fully grown male elephants!\n\n\nOne such claim\n\n\n  Compared to an elephant, the rhinoceros beetle looks minuscule. But\n  ounce for ounce, this insect is considered the world's strongest\n  creature Rhinoceros beetles, which get their name from the hornlike\n  structure on a male's head, are capable of carrying up to 850 times\n  their own body weight. A human with this relative strength would be\n  able to lift some 65 tons (59 metric tons).\n\n\nAnother such claim\n\nThis sounds really crazy, what is it the beetles actually does, and how heavy things is it they have lifted? \n\n\n  Male Hercules beetles can be up to 17cm long, and weigh up to 120g.\n  The species exhibits \u2018sexual dimorphism\u2019, which means that females and\n  males are very different in appearance. For a long time, scientists\n  thought that they were actually separate species; only the males have\n  horns (which make up to half of their body length). These horns are\n  used to fight other males, burrow into wood and move obstacles (like\n  sticks, rocks and small logs) out of its way.\n\n\nWeight of the beetle\n\nThe beetle seems to push around rocks, sticks and logs using its large horns.\nThe beetle's weight is in other words 120g, and can lift things 850 times its own weight.\n0.12kg * 850 = 102 kg. The beetle have apparently been shown to lift things weighting 102 kilos. This sounds pretty fantastic. How have those tests been done? Did the beetle really just grab a 102 kilo rock, and move it about?\n\nYoutube link\n\nIn the video, it shows the tests done by scientists in University of California, Berkeley, CA. And the beetle was shown to carry 100 times its own weight ON ITS BACK. The video says they tested that.\n\nDetails about the tests can be found in the paper \"INEXPENSIVE LOAD CARRYING BY RHINOCEROS BEETLES\" from 1995, from Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA.\n\nThere they tested how much the beetles energy consumption changed with carrying 30 times its body weight. And in the paper it's depicted the tests shown in the youtube video as well. The beetle could move pretty much unhindered with 30 times its weight. The paper didn't say anything about 100 times it's weight, but it wasn't completely related to the topic.\nWhere the number 850 times its weight comes from that is the question.\n\n\n  Females of the species will dig a tunnel into a pile of dung and males\n  will enter the tunnel looking to mate. If a male encounters another\n  male in the tunnel they will battle each other, each trying to remove\n  the other. The scientists tested the beetle's ability to resist rivals\n  by measuring how much weight was needed to pull a male beetle out of\n  his hole. That's how they know that it would take 1,141 other beetles\n  to pull a determined male dung beetle out of 'love tunnel'.\n\n\nIdea to where that idea might come from\n\nProbably a similar test was done to the Hercules beetle. That means the 850 times number is not for amount it carries on its back, but how strong it is.\n\nYes the beetle can carry 100 times its weight, on its back\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/15825#15856", "answerId": "15856"}

According to an estimate of world carbon emissions, that is roughly equivalent to nearly 2/3 of average annual emissions over recent years. So in that sense, the amount of carbon sequestered in peat is quite significant, and it makes sense that conserving peatlands should have a positive effect on climate.\n\nIt is certainly true that peat swamps emit greenhouse gasses, including methane, which has to be factored in. However, according to the International Peatland Society, \n\n\n  When considering the role of peatlands in atmospheric GHG balances, it is important to consider that they have taken up and released GHGs continuously since their formation and thus their influence must be modelled over time.

But the evidence has been a little mixed and often thought to be driven by its impact on sleep-deprived people (which is related to the licensed use).\n\nA recent systematic review (free abstract, paywalled full paper) has tried to make some sense of the other studies done in the last quarter century. It discusses the problems with previous studies thus:\n\n\n  In addition to its approved use treating excessive somnolence, modafinil is thought to be used widely off-prescription for cognitive enhancement. However, despite this popularity, there has been little consensus on the extent and nature of the cognitive effects of modafinil in healthy, non-sleep-deprived humans. This problem is compounded by methodological discrepancies within the literature, and reliance on psychometric tests designed to detect cognitive effects in ill rather than healthy populations. In order to provide an up-to-date systematic evaluation that addresses these concerns, we searched MEDLINE with the terms \u201cmodafinil\u201d and \u201ccognitive\u201d, and reviewed all resultant primary studies in English from January 1990 until December 2014 investigating the cognitive actions of modafinil in healthy non-sleep-deprived humans.\n\n\nAnd concludes (my emphasis):\n\n\n  We found that whilst most studies employing basic testing paradigms show that modafinil intake enhances executive function, only half show improvements in attention and learning and memory, and a few even report impairments in divergent creative thinking. In contrast, when more complex assessments are used, modafinil appears to consistently engender enhancement of attention, executive functions, and learning. Importantly, we did not observe any preponderances for side effects or mood changes.\n\n\nIn other words, when the types of cognitive improvement are properly evaluated, there are systematic improvement found for some specific cognitive processes.\n\nIn summarising the work, Guy Goodwin,  President of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, said this (again, my emphasis):\n\n\n  This overview suggests that, on current evidence, modafinil enhances cognition independent of its known effects in sleep disordered populations.

There is another meaning to the word, and if you meant that, then this answer isn't very useful.

I quote from the quadrivalent version that seems to have more reactions. \n\nThere are a number of possible reactions. Mild reactions are common, including pain at the injection site (83% of patients) and headaches (26%). Serious reactions are much rarer, with anaphylaxis occurring 0.00017% of the time.\n\nCompare that to BCG, and we find more occurrences of mild reactions with papules (lumps), mild ulcerations and/or scars occurring in \"almost all vaccinations\". There are also more occurrences of severe reactions, with local abscesses, infections and similar occurring in 0.01-0.1% of the time, osteitis (bone inflammation) occurring up to 0.03% of the time and Immune Reconstitution Syndrome occurring 0.00016% of the time (amongst other severe adverse events).\n\n10% of the Rubella portion of MMR vaccines leads to serious reactions - acute arthritis.

Wouldn't this be an even bigger bombshell?\n\n\nTo put a little actual backbone into it, though, check out this site; it does a nice job at quickly and simply debunking this.\n\nTo summarize the finer points of the above link:\n\n\nCheck out Princeton's research page - you won't find it there!\nThe author claims to have contacted Princeton about this, and received the following reply from a spokesperson (granted, without seeing an email, this is just as specious as the claim itself):\n\n\n  To confirm, we are not aware of any such research affiliated with anyone at Princeton and unfortunately we do not know where or why this e-mail chain started.\n  \n  We appreciate you informing your readers that this e-mail is a hoax.\n\nDon't forget, how do you think refrigerator doors stick when closed? Magnets! Furthermore, many electric motors (like the one that makes refrigerators work) generate electric and magnetic fields on their own - certainly larger than the miniscule one produced by a refrigerator magnet.\nThe above site also links to the National Cancer Institute, a great source for this kind of information. Looking at this linked page, one can see (with regard to humans):\n\n\n  No consistent association between magnetic fields and leukemia or brain tumors has been established.\n\n\nAnd to follow up on the whole mouse thing:\n\n\n  Animal studies have not found that magnetic field exposure is associated with increased risk of cancer (2). The absence of animal data supporting carcinogenicity makes it biologically less likely that magnetic field exposures in humans, at home or at work, are linked to increased cancer risk.\n\n\n\nSo no. There is nothing to worry about with refrigerator magnets. Unless you eat them. That might be a problem.\n\n(I also think a fair name for this whole fiasco could be: decorative magnets, how do they work!?)\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4459#4617", "answerId": "4617"}

Stenospermocarpic watermelons (or any other plants) pollinate properly, but the embryo aborts at a very young age. This causes a seedless fruit, which also tends to be sweeter.\n\n\n  Seedless banana and watermelon fruits are produced on triploid plants, whose three sets of chromosomes prevent meiosis from taking place and thus the plants cannot produce fertile gametes. Such plants can arise by spontaneous mutation or by hybridization between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same or different species.\n\n\n(reference)\n\nSo these watermelon plants don't produce male flowers, and it is necessary to plant a regular variety nearby, to pollinate the flowers. This could be why they were called female watermelons. But the male flowers never set fruit anyway, so all watermelons are from female flowers.\n\nAs for the black spot, it has more to do with variety than anything else, and though it will vary with the individual, I can speculate that the folk wisdom you mentioned was noting that the varieties that are seedless tended to have a larger black spot than the others, but I haven't noticed this myself.\n", "answerUrl": "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/11104#23245", "answerId": "23245"}

Burnt oil has many negative health effects. \n\nAs far as oils go, extra virgin olive oil has the very desirable property of a high smoke point, which means it is less likely to burn when cooked, and makes it an option for frying. That said, more refined oils like olive pomace oil have an even higher smoke point and lighter taste making them ideal for frying. (Ref.)\n\nKeep also in mind that the quality of the oil makes the smoke point vary significantly.\n\nThat said, as far as oils go, olive pomace oil, virgin olive oil and extra virgin olive oil are all \"healthy\" oils given low levels of saturated and polyunsaturated fats.\n\nRegarding cancer, extra virgin olive oil is considered a potential anticarcinogenic, so quite the opposite of the claim.\n\n\n  Compared to other vegetable oils, the presence of several phenolic antioxidants in olive oil is believed to prevent the occurrence of a variety of pathological processes, such as cancer.\n\n\n-- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24326154\n\n\n  There have been numerous evidences supporting the relationship between olive oil and cancer, with most of the attention being directed toward its fat and phenolic content.
